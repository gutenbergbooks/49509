<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="dropcap">There is an element of chance and risk
about an attempt to escape from an enemy’s
country which is bound to appeal to any
one with a trace of sporting instinct. Viewed
as a sport, though its devotees are naturally few
and hope to become fewer, it has a technique of
its own, and it may be better, rather than interrupt
the course of my narrative, to say here
something about this.</p>

<p>As always, appropriate equipment makes for
ease. But its lack, since a prisoner of war cannot
place an order for an ideal outfit, may be
largely compensated for by personal qualities.</p>

<p>In considering the chances of success or failure,
it must always be assumed that the route
leads through a country entirely unknown to
the fugitive. Yet this is not so great a disadvantage
as one might suppose. Once free from
towns and railways, a man with a certain knowledge
of nature and the heavens, and with some
powers of observation and deduction, can hardly
fail to hit an objective so considerable as a fron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>tier
line, even if a hundred miles or so have to
be traversed, provided he knows the position of
his starting-point and is favored with tolerable
weather.</p>

<p>With the sky obscured, he must at least have
a pocket compass by which to keep his direction;
though when the stars are visible it is
easier and safer to walk by their aid.</p>

<p>Next in importance come maps. With fairly
good maps, as well as a compass, the chances of
evading discovery before approaching the frontier,
with its zone of sentries and patrols, are,
in my opinion, about even.</p>

<p>Another indispensable requisite is a water-bottle&mdash;a
good big one. My own belief is that a
man in tolerable condition&mdash;let us say good internment-camp
condition&mdash;can keep going for
from two to three weeks on no more food than
he can pick up in the fields. But thirty hours
without water will, in most cases, be too much
for him. Under the tortures of thirst his determination
will be sapped. I was, therefore,
always willing to exchange the most direct route
for a longer one which offered good supplies of
water. In my final and successful attempt,
when I was leader of a party of three and had
to traverse a part of Germany where brooks and
streams are rare, I always preferred taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
risk of looking for fresh water rather than that
of being without it for more than twenty hours
between sources, relying in the meantime on
what we had in our bottles.</p>

<p>The more clothing one can take along the better&mdash;within
reason, of course. One is prepared
to do without a good deal, but food must, if
necessary, be sacrificed for a sweater and an
oilsilk. Two sets of underclothing to wear
simultaneously when the weather turns cold are
a comfort. Beyond this, any one will naturally
take such food as can be carried conveniently.
Chocolate, hardtack and dripping, with a little
salt, is, in my opinion, as much as one wants.
Being a deliberate person, I usually managed
to have enough of these in readiness before
I even thought of other arrangements for
the start.</p>

<p>People are very differently gifted with what
might be called the out-of-door sense, though
it is strong in some who have never really
led an out-of-door life. Those who have this
gift will know almost instinctively where to turn
in an emergency, and will gather from the lie of
the land information denied to those without it.
This raises the question of companionship.
As I am, fortunately, possessed of a fair share
of this open-air sense, it was little handicap to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
me to be alone on my first attempt. In fact, as
long as I was using the railways, it was a distinct
advantage. At critical moments a man can
decide more quickly what to do, if he has only
himself to think of, than when he has to consider
and possibly to communicate with a companion,
who may be contemplating a better but
quite different solution. To know that it is
only one’s own skin that is at stake gives one
that promptness of decision which is itself the
seed of success; the thought of involving another
man in an error easily clogs the swiftness
of one’s action.</p>

<p>On the march these conditions are reversed.
One can walk only at night, and the approach of
actual danger is best met by falling flat and
keeping motionless, or else taking to one’s heels.
It is under trying conditions just short of the
actual peril of discovery that the soothing influence
of a companion is of inestimable advantage.
Cross-country walking tries one’s nervous
forces to the utmost. Hour after hour passes,
and no recognizable landmark appears. At last
one gets the feeling of being condemned eternally
to tramp over fields, skirt woods, and extricate
oneself from an endless succession of morasses.
In time the sky seems to reel and the
compass-needle to point in all directions but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
right one. It is then that the voice of a friend,
the touch of his hand, or merely the sound of
his footsteps behind one, restores the sense of
normality which, if one is alone, can be recovered
only by a deliberate effort of will that is
often very exhausting.</p>

<p>Before starting I always knew roughly what
lay before me, and what I had to expect, until
I met either with success or with complete failure
by being captured. Even when the chances
seemed to suggest it, I would never trust blindly
to mere good luck, which I kept in reserve as an
absolutely last resource. Once in hiding for
the day, I usually worked out a detailed plan
for the following night’s walk, and spent hours
looking at the maps in order to impress on my
mind a picture, as complete as possible, of the
country directly in front of me and to each
side of my route.</p>

<p>When this book was first published I pointed
out, that “It is one of the penalties of an escape
that, so long as others remain behind, it is impossible
for obvious reasons to give too precise
details, and often the moments one would
most wish to describe have of necessity to be
camouflaged from the observation of the enemy.”
Now that the war is over and there is
nothing to hinder it, I have been able to aug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>ment
my original story with certain details
originally omitted for reasons mentioned above.
In its present form the book has been considerably
enlarged and no detail of my escape has
been omitted.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The date was April 7, 1916. The fat German
warder backed out of my cell, a satisfied
smile on his face; the door swung to, the
great key clicked in the lock, and I was alone.</p>

<p>Prison once more! And only a bare three
miles away was the frontier for which I had
striven so hard&mdash;the ditch and the barbed wire
that separated Germany, and all that that word
means, from Holland, the Hook, the London
boat, and freedom.</p>

<p>The game was lost. That was the kernel of
the situation as it presented itself to me, sitting
on my bed in the narrow, dark cell.</p>

<p>Vreden, where I thus found myself in prison,
is a little town hardly three miles from the
Dutch frontier, in the Prussian province of
Westphalia. So near&mdash;and indeed a good deal
nearer&mdash;had I got to liberty!</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before, my first attempt to
escape from Germany&mdash;which might be de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>scribed
with some justification as my third&mdash;had
failed, and instead of being a free man in a neutral
country, I was still a British civilian prisoner
of war.</p>

<p>Apart from the overwhelming sense of failure
which oppressed me, I was not exactly physically
comfortable. To start with, I wanted a
change of clothing and a real bath. I had not
had my boots off&mdash;except during several hours
when I was walking in bare feet for the sake of
silence&mdash;for over eight days, and for almost the
same length of time I had not even washed my
hands. The change of clothing was out of the
question. The bath&mdash;One does not feel as
if one has had a bath after an ablution in a
tin basin holding a pint of water, with a cake of
chalky soap the size of a penny-piece, and a
towel which, but for texture, would have made a
tolerable handkerchief. And no water to be
spilled on the floor of the cell, mind you!</p>

<p>My prison bed was an old, wooden “civilian”
one with a pile of paillasses on it, and the usual
two blankets. It was fairly comfortable to lie
on, as long as the numerous indigenous population
left you alone, which they rarely did.</p>

<p>The warder&mdash;the only one, I believe, in the
prison&mdash;had asked me immediately after my arrival
whether or not I had any money on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
When he heard I had not, his face fell. Since
he could not make me profitable he made me useful,
and put me to peeling potatoes in the morning,
a job I liked very much under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The food in Vreden prison was scanty, barely
sufficient. I was always moderately hungry,
and ravenous when meal-time was still two or
three hours off. Twice in four days I had an
opportunity of walking for twenty minutes
round the tiny prison yard, sunless and damp,
where green moss spread itself in three untrodden
corners, while the fourth was occupied
by a large cesspool. The rest of my time I
spent alone in my cell, now and again reading a
few pages of Jules Verne’s “Five Weeks in a
Balloon,” execrably translated into German and
lent me by the warder. But mostly I was busy
speculating about my immediate future, or
thinking of the eighteen months of my captivity
in Germany.</p>

<p>Technically, I was not being punished as yet
for my escape. I was merely being kept under
lock and key pending my removal back to
Ruhleben camp or to a prison in Berlin, I did not
know which. But if it was not punishment I
was undergoing in the little frontier town, it was
an excellent imitation of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Some experiences, exciting when compared
with the dull routine of camp life, were still
ahead of me; the journey to Berlin was something
to look forward to, at any rate. But what
would happen afterward? I did not know, for I
flatly refused to believe in solitary confinement
to the end of the war&mdash;the punishment which
had been suggested as in store for unsuccessful
escapers.</p>

<p>I had not escaped from Ruhleben, as my predecessors
had. I had walked out of a virtually
unguarded sanatorium in Charlottenburg, a
suburb of Berlin, where British civilian prisoners
of war, suffering from diseases and ailments
which could not be properly combated in
camp, were treated. Might not this give an
earnest to a plea which was shaping in my mind?
Could the Germans be persuaded to believe that
I had acted under the influence of an attack of
temporary insanity, caused by overwhelming
homesickness? True, I had “gone away” well
prepared; I had shown a certain amount of determination
and tenacity of purpose. On the
other hand, I had not destroyed any military
property. Of course, I had damaged a good
deal of property, but it wasn’t military property!
A fine point, but an important one, especially
in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the sort of reflections which
mostly occupied my four days in Vreden prison,
unreasoning optimism struggling desperately
against rather gloomy common sense.</p>

<p>What I looked forward to most in the solitude
of my cell was a meeting with my old friends in
Ruhleben camp in the near future. The other
escapers had all been returned to camp for a
short time before they were taken to prison, to
demonstrate to us ocularly the hopelessness of
further attempts. Surely the Germans would
do the same with me; and then I should get
speech with one or two of my particular chums.
For this I longed with a great longing, although
I did not look forward to telling them that I had
failed.</p>

<p>Only one of them knew the first links in the
chain of events which connected my sensations
of the first day of the war with the present,
when I was restlessly measuring the length of
my cell, or sitting motionless on the edge of the
bed, staring with dull eyes upon the dirty floor.
Under the pressure of my disappointment, and
without the natural safety-valve of talk to a
friendly soul, I naturally began to examine my
experiences during the war, opening the pigeon-holes
of my memory one by one, reliving an incident
here, revisualizing a picture there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
retracing the whole length of the&mdash;to me&mdash;most
important developments leading up to my attempted
escape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the storm clouds of the European war
were gathering I was living in Neuss, a town on
the left bank of the Rhine, between Düsseldorf,
a few miles to the north, and Cologne, twenty
miles to the south. I had been there a little over
a year. Immersed though I was in business, I
was by no means happy. I was distinctly tired
of Germany, and was on the point of cutting
short my engagements and leaving the “Fatherland.”</p>

<p>I had turned thirty some time before, and
hitherto my life, although it had led me into
many places, had been that of an ordinary business
man. In spite of unmistakable roaming
proclivities, it was likely to continue placidly
enough. Then suddenly everything was
changed.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about the 20th of July, I was
standing in the enclosure of the Neuss Tennis
Club, waiting for a game. The courts were
close to a point where a number of important
railway lines branched off toward Belgium
and France. I was watching and wondering
about the incessant traffic of freight-trains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which for days past had been rolling in that
direction at about fifteen-minute intervals.
They consisted almost exclusively of closed
trucks.</p>

<p>Another member of the club pointed his racket
toward one. “War material. Soldiers!” he
said succinctly. With a sinking heart I gazed
after the train as it disappeared from view.
The political horizon was clouded, but surely it
wouldn’t come to this! It couldn’t come to
this. It was impossible that it should happen.</p>

<p>The police, always troublesome and inquisitive
in Germany, seemed to be taking some unaccountable
interest in me. Nothing was further
from my mind than to connect this lively
interest in an obscure individual like myself
with anything so stupendous as a war.</p>

<p>And then it happened. War was declared.</p>

<p>I was warned not to leave the town without
permission. I was eating my head off in idleness
and anxiety. I hoped to be sent out of the
country at short notice, but the order to pack up
and be gone did not come. Instead, I was invited
to call upon the inspector of police at
9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> on the 27th of August. I obeyed. An
hour later I was locked up in a cell of an old,
evil-smelling, small prison. I did not know for
what reason, beyond the somewhat incompre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>hensible
one of being a British subject. Nor
did I know for how long. The inspector of police
had answered my questions with an Oriental
phrase: It was an order!</p>

<p>It appeared that the order referred to Britishers
of military age only, which, according to
it, began with the seventeenth and ended with
the thirty-ninth year. Thus it came about that
I made the acquaintance of three out of the six
Englishmen then temporarily living in Neuss,
but hitherto beyond my ken. They were all fitters
of a big Manchester firm, Messrs. Mather
&amp; Platt Ltd., employed in putting up a sprinkler
installation in the works of the International
Harvester Co., an American concern in Neuss.</p>

<p>We were treated comparatively well in prison.
Nevertheless, the days we had to pass in that
old, evil-smelling house of sorrows were interminable.
Most of our time we spent together,
in a locked-up part of the corridor on the second
floor. Outside it was glorious summer weather.
All our windows were open to the breeze, which
never succeeded in dispersing the stench pervading
the whole building. Sitting on the uncomfortable
wooden stools, or walking idly
about, we smoked incessantly, read desultorily
in magazines and books, and talked spasmodically.
And always the air vibrated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
faint, far-away, half-heard, half-sensed muttering
of distant guns. The news in the German
newspapers was never cheering to us.</p>

<p>As suddenly as we had been arrested we were
released from prison after eleven days, and confined
to the town.</p>

<p>There followed nine weeks of inactivity and
endless waiting. For the first time I gave a
fleeting thought to an attempt of making my
way out of Germany by stealth. It hardly
seemed worth while, as we were “sure of being
exchanged sooner or later”! Twice I left the
town for a few hours. On my return I always
found the police fully conversant with every one
of my moves, which showed how carefully they
were watching me. Having always provided
excellent explanations for my actions, I escaped
trouble over these escapades.</p>

<p>As announced beforehand in the German
press, we were arrested again on November 6,
1914. We passed four cheery days in the old
familiar prison, and then came the excitement
of our departure for Ruhleben camp, via Cologne,
where we and a hundred and fifty other
civilian prisoners, collected from the Rhine
provinces, spent a night in a large penal prison.</p>

<p>Under a strong escort we were marched to the
station at seven the following morning. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
starting we had been told that there was only
one punishment for misbehavior on transport&mdash;death!
Misbehavior included leaving the ranks
in the streets or leaning out of the windows
when in the railway carriages.</p>

<p>Entraining at eight o’clock, we did not reach
our final destination until twenty-three hours
later. The first hour or so of our journey was
tolerable. We were in third-class carriages.
Having had hardly any breakfast, and no tea or
supper the previous day, we soon became hungry
and thirsty. But we were not even allowed
to get a drink of water. Whenever the train
drew into a station, the Red Cross women
rushed toward our carriages with pots of coffee
and trays of food, under the impression that we
were Germans on the way to join our regiments.
But they were always warned off by uniformed
officials: “Nothing for those English swine.”
We were evidently beyond the pale of humanity.</p>

<p>At 2 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> we disembarked at Hanover station,
to wait two hours for another train. Here a
bowl of very good soup was served out to us.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> on the 12th of November our train
drew up at a siding. We were ordered roughly
to get out and form fours. It was dark and
cold. A thin drizzling rain was falling.
Hardly as cheerful as when we left Neuss, we
entered Ruhleben camp.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">RUHLEBEN: THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Ruhleben! A ride in a trolley car of
fifty minutes to the east, and one would
have been in the center of Berlin. Toward the
west the town of Spandau was plainly visible.
Shall we ever forget its sky-line&mdash;the forest of
chimneys, the tall, ugly outlines of the tower of
the town hall, the squat “Julius” tower, the
supposed “war treasury” of the Germans where
untold millions of marks of gold were alleged to
be lying!</p>

<p>Before the war the camp had been a trotting
race-course, a model of its kind in the way of
appointments. Altogether, six grand stands, a
restaurant for the public, a club-house for the
members of the Turf Club, administrative buildings,
and eleven large stables, all solidly built of
brick and concrete, illustrated German thoroughness.</p>

<p>These buildings, except the three smaller
grand stands, clustered along the west and south
sides of an oval track, which was not at first
included in the camp area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the beginning of the war the restaurant,
the “Tea House” as it was called, at the extreme
western end, and the large halls underneath
the three grand stands next to it had been
used to house refugees from eastern Prussia.
Then, an assorted lot of prisoners of war and
civilians interned, preponderantly Russian but
with a sprinkling of British and French subjects,
had taken their place. A few Russians
were still there when we arrived but evacuated
very soon after. Their departure made the
camp exclusively British.</p>

<p>We were given breakfast. It consisted of a
bowl of so-called coffee and a loaf of black bread.
The bread was to last us two days. Then we
were marched to our palatial residence, Stable
No. 5. We set to work to remove the plentiful
reminders of the former four-legged inhabitants
and installed ourselves as best we might.</p>

<p>The stables contained twenty-four box-stalls
and two tiny rooms for stable personnel on the
ground floor, and two large hay-lofts above.
Six men to a box-stall was the rule, and as many
as could be packed into the lofts. I had experience
in both quarters, for I slept in the loft for
more than a week, and then moved into “Box
No. 6,” where a space on the floor had become
empty. My new quarters were, at first, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
less attractive than the loft. They offered, however
greater possibilities for improvement.</p>

<p>For six weeks we slept on a stone floor covered
by an inch or so of wet straw. We had
just room enough to lie side by side. We could
turn over, if we did so together. The “loftites”
slept on boards with straw on top of them.
Later we all got ticks into which we could pack
the wet and fouling straw. To start with, there
was no heating. Then steam-radiators were installed,
and during this winter and the three
following, the stone barracks were heated in a
fitful kind of way. The locomobile boilers
which furnished the steam, one for each three
or four barracks, delivered it into the radiators
from 10 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> to 12 noon and from 3 to 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>At last the “boxites” received bedsteads.
They consisted of a simple iron framework with
three-quarter-inch boards as mattresses. On
these we placed our ticks. The bed uprights
had male and female ends which permitted the
building of as many superimposed bunks as
seemed practicable. Two sleeping-structures
of three bunks each was the rule in the boxes.</p>

<p>The food we received from the Germans was
insufficient at any time. The allowance per man
for rations was sixty-five pfennigs per day&mdash;sixteen
cents at the pre-war rate of exchange.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
It was contracted for at this price by a caterer.</p>

<p>While food in Germany was plentiful we could
buy additions to our rations at the canteen.
This became gradually impossible. We didn’t
mind that much, as parcels containing food and
other necessities, but mainly food, began to arrive
from England in ever-increasing number.
Relatives of prisoners, the firms they had been
working for, and trade-unions or other organizations
to which they belonged started the ball
rolling. But when the real need of the prisoners
became known in Blighty, special organizations
for the purpose of assisting them sprang
up everywhere. As they were independent of
one another their work to a great extent overlapped.
The majority of the civilians interned
received too much; here and there a man received
nothing at all. Through the action of the
British Government the work of the individual
societies was coördinated in November, 1916.
From that date, the Order of the Red Cross and
St. John was in charge of all of the relief work
for prisoners of war, and each prisoner received
six parcels of food per lunar month, not
counting two loaves of white bread per week.</p>

<p>As far as my experience goes, the German
authorities made an effort to have these parcels
reach their destination. During the latter part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of my imprisonment deliveries became somewhat
irregular. Food was scarce at that time
in some parts of Germany and commanded very
high prices, and the theft of parcels naturally
increased.</p>

<p>Ruhleben camp was administered, at first, by
the German officers in charge, with the help of
the interned. In the spring of 1916, all of the
internal affairs of the camp were placed in the
hands of the interned themselves, the Germans
confining themselves to guard duties and general
supervision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much has been published about prisoners’
camps in Germany. Horrible stories have been
told about them, and these are in the main quite
true. But camps differed from one another;
nor were the conditions in a given camp always
the same. I’m not suggesting gradual or
steady improvement. But, just as camp commanders
and regional military commanders differed,
so did the treatment of their charges differ.
As prisoners of war the men in Ruhleben
camp were a pretty lucky lot. The choice flowers
of <em>Kultur</em> bloomed elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the beginning of our internment hopes of a
speedy exchange to England ran high, and so did
rumors concerning it. They helped us to en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>dure
the hardships of the first few months, hardships
which might have proved even less tolerable
than they did without some such sheet-anchor
of faith.</p>

<p>In spite of the misery of the first winter, however,
the majority of the pro-English portion of
the camp would at any time have refused a
chance of living “free” in Germany under the
conditions we experienced previous to our internment.
This certainly was the prevailing
opinion among my friends, as it was mine. In
camp, at any rate, we could wag our tongues,
and speak as we listed, if we took only ordinary
precautions. We had congenial companions,
and shared our joys and discomforts. As long
as our health remained tolerable, who would
not have preferred this to liberty among German
surroundings? But when illness came
upon us&mdash;and few escaped it altogether&mdash;it was
rather a tough proposition.</p>

<p>The colonial Britishers were not at first considered
to come under the heading “<em>Englander</em>.”
Probably the Germans were waiting
for the disruption of the British Empire and
intended to further it by partial treatment
of men from our colonies, for they let them
remain at liberty until the end of January, 1915.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
It was then that the colonials arrived in
Ruhleben.</p>

<p>Later came the separation of the sheep from
the goats! There was trouble in camp. It had
started in a ridiculous manner. A young lad
had been overheard saying something about
“bloody Germans,” and this had been reported
to the authorities by one of their spies. German
self-esteem was horribly hurt, the more so
as they misunderstood the epithet and interpreted
it as “bloodthirsty.” Whispers of impending
trouble had reached us, and we were
not astonished when, one morning&mdash;I believe in
February or March, 1915&mdash;the alarm bell
sounded the “line up.” Each barracks separately
formed up in a hollow square in front of
its dwelling-place. And each barracks was addressed
separately by the camp commander,
Baron von Taube. He was in a perfect frenzy
of rage when our turn came. Our barracks was
one of the last spoken to, and how he managed
to keep up the performance after so many repetitions
is a thing I cannot easily understand.</p>

<p>“We shall be the victors in this war thrust
upon us by your country!” he shouted at us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
“And here and now I fling your own expression
back into your faces. Bloody Englishmen I call
you! Bloody Englishmen!” He thumped his
chest like a gorilla about to charge. He came
near to foaming at the mouth. So far it was
merely amusing. Then came the order: “All
those who entertain friendly feelings toward
Germany fall out and hand in your names.”</p>

<p>Our barracks was rather a mixed one, many of
its inhabitants being pro-German in sentiment.
In addition, good and loyal men all over the
camp, whose financial interests were entirely in
Germany, became panicky and went over to the
other side in the futile hope of saving their
property. When they had gone to the office,
we others were dismissed. Excitedly we discussed
what had happened. Many of us were
deeply disturbed. They were those who
thought they had flung their all into a well, as it
were, by standing still when the pro-Germans
fell out. But we all hoped that the others
would be quartered apart from us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that was not the case. They
came back and lived among us for some time,
their presence giving rise to many a quarrel.</p>

<p>Some months afterward another separation
of the sheep from the goats took place, much
less dramatically, and this time the pro-Germans
were quartered all by their sweet selves
at one end of the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>In April, 1915, two men escaped from the hospital
barracks, situated outside the barbed-wire
enclosure, and but carelessly guarded. One of
them became a great friend of mine later on.</p>

<p>When these two men escaped, I was playing
with the idea myself. It was a very fine spring.
In the afternoons I used to sit on the uppermost
tier of the big grand stand. High up as I was,
the factory buildings and chimneys toward the
west, where Spandau lay, appeared dwarfed;
and gazing across with my book on my knees, I
had a sense of freedom. I used to dream extravagant
dreams of flights in aëroplanes with
Germany gliding backward beneath my feet,
with the fat pastures of Holland unrolling from
the horizon, with the gray glint of the sea appearing,
and the shores of England lying rosy
under a westering sun. And then, coming down
to realities, I began seriously to speculate upon
the chances of “getting through.”</p>

<p>I soon came to the conclusion that a companion
was desirable, a good man who spoke German
well, as I did; a man with plenty of common
sense about him. I found one in April, T&mdash;&mdash;,
a native of the state of Kansas. Lack of money
made an early attempt impossible. I had
enough for myself, but my friend was dependent
upon the five shillings per week relief money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
paid by the British Government to those who
had no resources of their own. I could not get
hold of sufficient money for the two of us at
once, so I set myself to accumulate gradually
the necessary amount.</p>

<p>But the summer passed, the leaves began to
turn yellow, and my pocket-book still contained
less than I thought necessary.</p>

<p>In June of that year a successful escape from
camp and from Germany by Messrs. Pyke and
Falk set us all talking and wondering. Then, in
quick succession, two serious attempts by a
couple of men each failed. News was allowed
to reach us that they would be kept in solitary
confinement until the end of the war. This inhuman
punishment was not actually put into
effect, but the unfortunates got five months’ and
four and a half months’ solitary confinement
respectively, and after that indefinite detention
in prison.</p>

<p>My companion and I heard only about the
first sentence. It somewhat staggered us; but
we decided that, as we did not intend to be
caught, the punishment ought not to deter us,
and that if we were caught we could stick it
out as well as the next man.</p>

<p>The days were growing shorter, the nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
colder, the boughs of the trees barer, and conditions
generally more unfavorable, and still
we hung on. Then the military authorities
began doubling the number of wire fences
around the camp and erecting plenty of extra
light-standards in the space between them.
Also, the number of sentries was increased.
All this decided us to have “a shot at it” there
and then, before the additional fences were completed.</p>

<p>We had hoped for an overcast sky. Instead,
the full moon was bathing the camp in light.
Feeling anything but comfortable, we walked up
to that part of the wire fence where we intended
to scramble over. We were just getting ready,
when a sentry came around the corner of the
barracks outside the wire. We had never observed
the man on that beat before. He
stopped short, and his rifle came to the ready.
“We’re camp policemen, if he asks,” I whispered
to my companion. Lingering a moment
as if in conversation, we then walked slowly
away. We decided not to try again that night.</p>

<p>The next morning I was disgusted with myself
and all the world. I talked it over with my
companion, and he agreed with me that it was
“no go” that year. Another week of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nights would see the wire fences completed and
the season so far advanced that the odds would
be too heavy against us.</p>

<p>For some days I chewed the bitter cud of disappointment.
Then I told my friend that I
should be glad to go with him, if he had an opportunity,
but that in the meantime I should
take any chance, if one came to me, alone. He
expressed approval.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SANATORIUM</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Toward the end of November an old
Scotsman, a member of my barracks
(No. 5), was returned to camp from the sanatorium
in Charlottenburg. I questioned him
about the place. It appeared that no desperate
illness was necessary to get there, as long as one
was willing to pay for oneself instead of coming
down upon the British Government funds ordinarily
provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>This institution was a private medical establishment
known as Weiler’s Sanatorium. The
camp administration, by now in our own hands,
had made arrangements with the proprietors to
receive and treat such cases of illness or ill-health
as could not be treated adequately in
camp, where the accommodation in the infirmary,
measured on civilized standards, was of the
roughest.</p>

<p>Having a big scar on my left thigh, the only
reminder of a perfectly healed compound fracture
many years old, I believed sciatica a likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
complaint to acquire. Except in extreme cases
no observable changes take place in the affected
limb, and the statement of the patient is the only
means of diagnosis. Forthwith I developed a
gradually increasing limp. With it I got
grumpy and ill-tempered, the limp preventing
me from taking my usual exercise, and this soon
had its effect.</p>

<p>At regular and short intervals I went to see
the doctor. To start with, I got sympathy from
him, and aspirin. But nothing did me any good,
though I admitted to an occasional improvement
when the weather was fine and dry. At last I
was taken into the <em>Schonungsbaracke</em> and
put under a severe course of sweating. I stuck
it out, but came dangerously near throwing up
the sponge before I was released at the end of
a week of it. By that time I had made up my
mind that my sciatica ought to be cured, at least
temporarily.</p>

<p>I kept away from the doctor for some time,
but after a fortnight, during which my limp had
gradually increased again, I was back in the surgery.
He admitted that under camp conditions
a lasting cure, even of a mild case like
mine, was hardly to be thought of; but since
the Schonungsbaracke was full, there was
nothing for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> “but to stay in bed as much as
possible” and to swallow aspirin. This treatment
suited me excellently well.</p>

<p>I kept hanging about the surgery complaining
mildly until the first days of February, when the
weather was rotten. I had a serious attack
then. I knew the Schonungsbaracke to be still
full, and this gave me the opportunity of
asking to be transferred for treatment to the
sanatorium.</p>

<p>My case being considered urgent, I left the
camp the same afternoon, accompanied by a
soldier and a box-mate of mine who had volunteered
to carry my luggage&mdash;for I was unable,
of course, even to lift it. With somewhat mingled
feelings I looked my last upon Ruhleben
for many a long day.</p>

<p>My new home had originally been intended for
nervous cases only&mdash;a private lunatic asylum, to
put it bluntly. The arrangement with the camp
authorities for the treatment of all kinds of ailments
among a population of over four thousand
was taxing its capacity to the utmost. So
many of our men were there at this time that
they not only filled the original institution but
were housed and treated in several dwellings
leased by the proprietors in addition to the
asylum.</p>

<p>This was a large building with an extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
garden at 38 Nussbaum Allee, Charlottenburg.
The appellation “Nussbaum Allee” distinguished
it from the other houses, of which
there were four, if I am not mistaken. I forget
their names, however, with the exception of
“Linden Allee.”</p>

<p>There were two classes of patients, whose
food and accommodation differed according to
the amount they paid, or which was paid for
them by the British Government through the
American Embassy. First-class treatment cost
at that time twelve marks per day exclusive of
medicines and special treatment. Without exception
the expense had to be defrayed by the
patient himself. In the second-class eight
marks per day was charged. Neither class
could expect private bedrooms for this, except
where infectious ailments or other medical reasons
made separate rooms imperative.</p>

<p>I had offered to pay my own expenses, to
avoid delay by having my case referred to the
American Embassy. It was a matter of indifference
to me what class I was put into. The
points of comfort I was looking for were easily
opened windows, etc. I liked fresh air at any
time, but now was particularly impressed by a
theory of mine, that fresh air could be admitted
in sufficient quantities only by windows not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
too high from the ground and large enough to
admit, or rather to give exit to, a fairly bulky
man.</p>

<p>The windows looked all right, but, from my
point of view, they were <em>not</em>. They had diamond
panes set in cast-iron frames; and even if
they opened, a dog could not have got out of the
aperture. All the corridor doors were kept
constantly locked. There was no passing from
one part of the building to another without the
help of a warder or a nurse. The idea of having
to sleep in the same room with six or eight
people, one or two of them seriously ill, did not
appeal to me. One of them was always sure to
be awake at night. Straightway I applied for
first-class treatment, for this would get me sent
to the “Linden Allee Villa,” where these lunatic-asylum
precautions would probably be absent.</p>

<p>I was taken there in the course of the following
morning. My assumption proved correct,
for things were different. Twelve patients
nearly occupied the available accommodation.
The staff consisted of only a nurse and three
servant girls, and no military guard was about
the place. The biggest bedrooms contained
three beds. A garden surrounded the house, accessible
through at least three doors and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
number of windows of the ordinary French
pattern. A low iron railing separated the garden
from the streets, which in this part of the
town were very wide, and which frequently had
two causeways, lined with trees, and divided by
stretches of lawn and thick shrubbery.</p>

<p>Not far from “Linden Allee” a big artery ran
right into Berlin.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">PLANNING THE DETAILS</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The outlines of my plan of escape had been
conceived almost a year before in Ruhleben,
and had remained unaltered.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the chances of success
were so small that I was convinced it could be
achieved only by the elimination of every unnecessary
risk, and with a considerable amount
of good fortune thrown in to make up for the
unavoidable balance on the wrong side.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we civilians were
interned right in the center of Germany. There
were three neutral countries to make for: Denmark,
Holland, and Switzerland, distant from
Ruhleben in that order. My choice fell upon
Holland, which, from information I had obtained,
seemed to offer the best opportunities.</p>

<p>Denmark, being only about a hundred and
fifty miles away, had at first appeared very
tempting. But the difficulty of crossing the
Kiel Canal, the extraordinarily close watch kept
all over Schleswig-Holstein and the frontier,
lack of information about the state of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
along the Baltic coast, and the obvious difficulty
of making a passage in a stolen boat to the
nearest point on the Danish coast, twenty-five
miles away, decided me against this plan.
Switzerland was about six hundred miles distant,
and the railway journey, with its attendant
dangers, correspondingly long. Also, we had
heard that part of the Swiss frontier, at least,
was impregnably guarded. There remained
Holland, about four hundred miles away.</p>

<p>In view of my thorough knowledge of German,
I did not believe the railway journey an
impossible undertaking. It appeared more
feasible, at any rate, than the four-weeks’
tramp to the frontier with what scant food one
could carry. Up to the last moment I tried to
get information as to whether special passports
were necessary for traveling on a train, and
whether they would be inspected on taking the
ticket, or during the journey. I had contradictory
accounts about this.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the sanatorium, I very soon
made up my mind to the following mode of procedure:
A stay at the “Linden Allee” until the
30th of March would give me about four weeks
in which to recruit my health, which was none
of the best after a grueling winter in camp.
Then, with a new moon on the 1st of April, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
succession of dark nights would be favorable
for my purpose. On account of the weather, it
might become advisable to delay the start a day
or two; but if exceptionally wintry conditions
should be prevailing then, a postponement until
the moon had again changed through all her
phases would become necessary. Trying to imagine
conditions near the frontier, I had come to
the conclusion that with snow on the ground,
giving a considerable range of vision even during
the darkest hours of the night, a successful
passage through the sentry lines would be out of
the question. On the other hand, the nights
would be much shorter at the end of April, and
this made me nervous lest such a postponement
should be forced upon me. The task of getting
out of the sanatorium and making my way into
Berlin did not trouble me at all. It was as easy
as falling off a log. Such of my things as I
should deem necessary or very desirable for the
exploit, I was going to take with me in a small
leather Gladstone bag.</p>

<p>From newspapers I had learned that a
train left Berlin for Leipzig at 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> My absence
would probably not be discovered before
the first breakfast, served in bed at 7:45 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>
Thus I could be a good many miles away when
the alarm reached headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Leipzig was not on my direct route toward
the Dutch frontier, but it appeared very attractive
as my first objective, partly for that reason.
It is a big place, and a man could easily pass in
the crowd there for a day, while the shops would
allow me to complete my equipment with a compass
and maps.</p>

<p>In Berlin the sale of the latter was prohibited
except with a permit from the army corps commander.
This ordinance was savagely enforced
and probably strictly observed. Leipzig&mdash;the
center of the German printing-trade, and, in the
Kingdom of Saxony, not in Prussia&mdash;was the
place where one could hope to obtain them, if
anywhere.</p>

<p>In another way the fact of Leipzig being in a
different state was in my favor. Any efforts
of the Berlin police to recapture me would very
likely be retarded if the case had to be handed
over to a distinct and independent police organization.</p>

<p>I hoped that when I arrived in Dortmund,
some time during the morning following my
escape from the sanatorium, I could make my
way by slow trains to the small town of Haltern.</p>

<p>This is situated in the northwestern corner of
the province of Westphalia on the northern
bank of the river Lippe. The nearest part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Holland from there is only twenty-five miles
distant as the crow flies, and no river of any size
intervenes, an important consideration for the
time of year I had fixed upon. Moreover, it is
nowhere near the Rhine. As I had lived in the
northern part of the Rhine province, the danger
of being accidentally seen by a former acquaintance
bade me keep away from that district.</p>

<p>There remained the smaller details of my plan
to work out, file, and put together. Some of
them were planned and executed before I left
camp. For example, I had grown a beard during
the winter 1915-16. This altered my appearance
and lent itself to another alteration,
back to the original. I bethought myself in the
“Linden Allee” that the Germans would probably
expect me to shave it off. A good reason
for not doing so.</p>

<p>The universal practice of the Boches in both
civil and military camps was to mark all the
clothing of prisoners of war so distinctively that
the status of the wearer could be recognized at a
glance, if ever he got away. These marks consisted
at first of stripes of vivid color painted
down the seams of their trousers and around
their arms, and fancy figures, circles, triangles,
etc., on their backs. Later, stripes of brown material
were sewn into the trousers and sleeves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the original material having first been cut away.</p>

<p>This practice never obtained in Ruhleben,
where we were allowed to wear what we liked.
During two winters in camp I had made use of a
very strong and warm suit of Manchester cord.
It was now considerably the worse for wear,
bleached by sun and rain and darkened again by
mud and grease, rather conspicuous in its state
of dilapidation, and, in camp, very distinctly
connected with me. For months I had kept
hidden in my trunk an inconspicuous gray jacket
suit. When I went to the sanatorium it was
packed away under other things at the bottom
of my hand-bag. All the time at the villa I wore
my cord suit, explaining that I had no other
clothes, but was waiting for some on the way
from England. I must have cut a very queer
figure among my companions, but any one
among them could conscientiously swear, after
my departure, that I must have left in a brown
cord suit, for, obviously, I had no other. The
good ulster overcoat I intended to make use of
could hardly give me away. Probably half a
million similar ones were being worn in Germany
at that time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the first week in March, winter set in
again and held the land for a fortnight. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
abruptly, spring burst upon us&mdash;that glorious
early spring of 1916 with its long succession of
sunny, warm days and crisp, starlit nights.</p>

<p>A change in the number and distribution of
the inmates had left me with only one companion
in our bedroom. He was confined to bed with
heart disease. I became rather nervous lest my
unexpected disappearance and the following inevitable
investigation should upset him. To
minimize this possible shock I took him into my
confidence.</p>

<p>As “the day” approached I got my things
ready as unobtrusively as I could, gradually
packing my small grip and finally destroying
letters and private papers. It was then that my
room-mate showed the first signs of unfeigned
interest.</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, suddenly, “so you
meant it, after all! Pardon my having been
incredulous so far, but I’ve heard so many fellows
talk about what they intended to do, without
ever seeing anybody doing it that I didn’t
quite realize you were the exception that proves
the rule. Don’t worry about me, and the best
of luck to you.”</p>

<p>The limp with which I had arrived at the sanatorium
I had gradually relinquished as I announced
improvements in my condition. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to be resumed on the journey as a sort of disguise,
an unasked-for explanation for my not
being in the army.</p>

<p>I had put aside some food, namely, a big German
smoked sausage, still obtainable though
very expensive, and containing a considerable
amount of nourishment, a tin of baked beans,
some biscuits, some chocolate, and a special anti-fatigue
preparation. A green woolen shirt, a
thick sweater, two pairs of socks, an extra set of
underclothing, a stout belt, and a naval oilskin,
filled the bag almost to the bursting-point.
Watch, electric torch, knife, and money were to
be carried on my person.</p>

<p>About this time my first monthly account was
due from the sanatorium. I dared not ask for
it, neither could I leave without paying. Apart
from the moral aspect of vanishing and leaving
an unsettled bill behind, such an act would certainly
have resulted in criminal proceedings
against me for theft or larceny, in the event of
my being captured, and, according to the German
application of the law where Englishmen
were concerned, as certainly in conviction with a
maximum sentence. So I decided to leave
enough money in a drawer of my dressing-table
to cover my bill.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">A GLIMPSE OF FREEDOM</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Contrary to my expectations, I hardly
felt any excitement during my last day at
the “Linden Allee.” My mental attitude was
rather a disinterested one, as if I were watching
somebody else’s escape.</p>

<p>When I got into bed at the usual time, I immediately
fell asleep, having first made up my
mind to wake at 3:30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> I awoke an hour
sooner, and went to sleep again. It was close
on four o’clock when I opened my eyes for the
second time. Getting up noiselessly, I carried
the Gladstone and a big hand-bag containing my
clothes, boots, etc., into the bath-room on the
first floor. There I lathered my shaving brush
and shaved a few hairs off my left forearm,
leaving the safety-razor on the washstand, uncleaned,
to create the impression that I had
shaved off my beard. I dressed as rapidly as I
could, throwing my pajamas on the floor and
leaving generally a fair amount of disorder behind
me. A breathless trip to the loft of the
house to conceal my cord suit behind some beams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
was executed with as much speed and caution
as I could manage. With my bag in one hand
and my boots round my neck, I descended again
by the light of the electric torch, slipped into my
overcoat in the hall, and, snatching my hat from
the rack, entered the dining-room. From there
a French window gave upon a porch to which a
few steps led up from the garden. The window
offered no resistance and, fortunately, the protecting
roller-blind was not down. A few
women, probably ammunition workers, passed
the house, and when they were out of hearing I
stepped out.</p>

<p>It was still dark, though the dawn was
heralded in the east. In a spot previously selected
for the reason that it was screened by
bushes, and from which I could survey the street
without being seen, I got over the fence. I had
barely done so when a cough sounded some distance
behind me. With a chill racing up and
down my spine, I walked on. Turning the near
corner, I threw a hasty glance over my shoulder,
but could see no one. Nevertheless, I thought
it wise to walk back on my tracks around several
blocks, before I made for the big thoroughfare
which led toward Berlin.</p>

<p>A number of people were about, men and
women, going to work. Keeping on, I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
after a lapse of about fifteen minutes to a station
of the Elevated. It was now five o’clock.</p>

<p>When I went up the steps to the booking-hall,
night was slowly withdrawing before the vanguard
of the approaching day. The electric
lights in the streets flashed once and were dead.
In the station they were beginning to show pale
and ineffective.</p>

<p>To my relief, people were entering the station
with me. Obviously, there was a service of
trains this early, though I had been in doubt
about it till then. The taking of a ticket to
Friedrich Strasse Station, one of the chief stations
in Berlin, cost me some agitation. It
meant the first test of my ability to “carry on.”</p>

<p>“Friedrich Strasse! Ten minutes to six! I
must find the restaurant and have breakfast.”
There is no sense in neglecting the inner man;
no experienced campaigner will voluntarily
risk it.</p>

<p>Friedrich Strasse was a most uncomfortable
place to be in. It swarmed with soldiers, and
its intricate passages and stairs were plastered
with placards: “Station Provost Marshal,”
“Military Passport Office,” “Passports to be
shown here,” “For Military only.”</p>

<p>At last I found a snug little waiting-room and
restaurant, where I got a fairly decent meal, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>cluding
eggs, which at the time were still obtainable
without ration-cards, and rolls, for
which I ought to have delivered up some bread-tickets,
but didn’t. As soon as I had a chance,
I bought a newspaper and some cigarettes.
Either might help one over an awkward moment.</p>

<p>The train for Leipzig left from a station I
knew nothing about except the name. The easiest
way for me to get there was by cab. A number
of these were standing in front of Bahnhof
Friedrich Strasse.</p>

<p>“Anhalter Bahnhof,” I said curtly to the
driver of the first four-wheeler on the rank.
Cabby mumbled something about <em>Marke</em>
through a beard of truly amazing wildness.
Then only did I recollect that it is necessary before
taking a cab from a station rank in Berlin
to obtain a brass shield, with its number, from
a policeman stationed inside the booking-hall.
Back I went, overcoming as best I might the
terrifying aspect of the blue uniform close to
me. Fortunately, the man was extraordinarily
polite for a Prussian officer of the law, and inquired
solicitously what particular kind of cab
I should like, and whether it was to be closed
or open. It was to be closed.</p>

<p>I had twenty minutes to spare after I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
alighted from the cab in front of my destination.
This station appeared less crowded than the former
one, although a considerable number of soldiers
were in, or passing through, the big hall.
The moment had come when one of the main
points of my plan was to be put to the test.
Could I obtain a long-distance ticket without
a passport? I waited until several people approached
the booking-office, then lined up behind
them. One of them asked for a second-class
ticket to Leipzig, and got it without any formality.
I considered myself quite safe when I repeated
his demand.</p>

<p>The train, a corridor-express, was crowded.
The hour was early for ordinary people, and nobody
seemed in the least talkative. To guard
against being addressed, I had bought enough
German literature of the bloodthirsty type to
convince anybody of my patriotic feelings, but I
hardly looked at it. I was too much interested
in watching the country flashing past the
window and in speculating upon what it would
be like near the Dutch frontier.</p>

<p>At Leipzig, where we arrived at 9:30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, I
had my little Gladstone taken to the cloak-room
by a porter, to give more verisimilitude to my
limp. For the same reason I made it my first
business to buy a stout walking-stick at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
nearest shop. After that I got a good luminous
compass, whose purchase was another test case.
When it was treated as an everyday transaction
by the man behind the counter my spirits rose,
and the acquisition of maps appeared a less formidable
undertaking. Nevertheless, I resolved
to leave their purchase to the afternoon.
Should I find that suspicion was aroused by my
request for “a good map of the province of
Westphalia,” I intended to nip away on the
earliest train, if I could reach the station unarrested.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning I spent limping
through the town, keeping very much on the
alert all the time. The tortuous, narrow streets
of the inner town, with their old high-gabled
houses in curious contrast with the modern
buildings and clanging tram-cars, were a delight
to me as well as a difficulty; the latter in so far
as I had to keep account of my whereabouts, the
better to be able to act swiftly in an emergency.
Gradually I got into more modern streets, wide
and straight. In passing I had made a mental
note of a likely-looking restaurant to have lunch
in later on.</p>

<p>At last I found myself in a public park, where
I rested on a seat for some time. A shrewd
wind, which whistled through the bare branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of the trees, made me wrap myself tighter in my
greatcoat.</p>

<p>I started to walk back to the restaurant at
midday, following for the greater part of the
way in the wake of three fat and comfortable-looking
burghers, who were deciding the war
and the fate of nations in voices loud enough for
me to follow their conversation, although thirty
paces behind. In the restaurant I had a meal,
somewhat reduced in quality and quantity, for
a little more than I should have paid in peace
times. Over a cigarette I then started to look
up my evening train in the time-table I had
bought at the station. Unable to find what I
wanted, I grew hot and cold all over. I had by
no means speculated upon having to stay in any
town overnight, and should not have known how
to act had I been forced to do so. This question
had to be settled there and then, so I went to the
station and the inquiry office. I was told that I
could get a train at 7:50 or 8 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>&mdash;I forget
which&mdash;to Magdeburg, and from there catch
the express for the west to Dortmund.</p>

<p>The first part of the afternoon I spent in several
cafés, unhappy to be within four walls, yet
wanting to rest as much as possible. Toward
five o’clock I nervously set forth to buy the maps
and some other less important things. I passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
several booksellers’ shops with huge war-maps
displayed in the windows, but my feet, seemingly
of their own volition, carried me past
them. When I finally plucked up enough
courage to enter a shop, my apprehension
proved quite unnecessary. I came away with
a fine motor-map and another one, less useful
generally but giving some additional information.
After that the rest of my equipment was
rapidly acquired: a pair of night binoculars,
wire-clippers, a knapsack, a very light oilskin,
and a cheap portmanteau to carry these things
in. By a fortunate chance I saw some military
water-bottles in a shop window, which reminded
me that I had nearly overlooked this very important
part of a fugitive’s rig-out. I got a
fine aluminum one.</p>

<p>By this time it was getting dark. The best
way of spending what remained of my time in
Leipzig was to have a leisurely meal in the station
restaurant.</p>

<p>While I was waiting to be served, a well-dressed
man at a table opposite attracted my
attention. He came into the room soon after
me, and seemed to take a suspicious interest in
my person. He stared at me, openly and otherwise.
When he did the former, I tried to outstare
him. After he had twice been worsted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
this contest he kept a careful but unobtrusive
watch over the rest of the people in the restaurant,
but took no further notice of me, not
even when I crossed the room later on to buy at
the counter as many sweet biscuits and as much
chocolate as I dared. After that I sat reading a
book with a lurid cover whereon a German submarine
was torpedoing a British man-of-war
among hectic waves. Taking advantage of the
short-sightedness implied by my glasses, I held
it close to my eyes, so that onlookers might have
the benefit of the soul-inspiring cover, and look
at that instead of my face.</p>

<p>A porter, whom I had tipped sufficiently to
make it worth his while, came to fetch my
luggage and see me into the train, where I had a
compartment to myself. As soon as we were
moving, I executed a wild but noiseless war-dance
to relieve my overcharged feelings, and
then had my first good look at the maps.</p>

<p>At Magdeburg I had only a few minutes to
wait for the express to Belgium, which was
to arrive at midnight. It turned out to be split
into three sections, following each other at ten-minute
intervals. I took the first of the trains.
The second-class compartment I entered was occupied
by an officer of the A. M. C. and two non-commissioned
officers. The latter soon left us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
having bribed the guard, so it seemed, to let
them go into the first-class. In this way the
medical officer and I had the whole compartment
to ourselves. We lay down at full length, and I
slept with hardly an interruption until 4:30, half
an hour before the train was due at Dortmund.</p>

<p>At Dortmund the waiting-room I went to
was almost empty. I left my luggage in the
care of a waiter, and went out to have a wash
and brush-up. This expedition gave me an opportunity
to learn something about the station
before I got a fresh ticket. I saw that to do this
I should have to pass ticket-gates which were in
charge of an extraordinarily strong guard with
fixed bayonets. The importance of Dortmund
as a manufacturing town, coupled with its situation
in the industrial district of the West, the
vulnerable point of Germany, explained these
precautions.</p>

<p>Back in the waiting-room, a liquid called coffee
and a most unsatisfactory kind of war bread
had to take the place of a Christian breakfast.
From the time-table I learned that there was a
local train to Wanne at about 6:30. It just
missed connection with another one from Wanne
to Haltern, if I recollect rightly. The prospect
of having to wait over two hours in a small town
on the edge of the industrial district, before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
could get a train, was not particularly inviting,
but there was no alternative. My ticket was
taken only at the last minute; then Dortmund
was left behind.</p>

<p>For most of the way to Wanne I traveled in
the company of two young civilians, massively
built and pictures of health. When they
had left I hastily packed my impedimenta in the
new portmanteau, leaving the Gladstone empty,
with the intention of depositing it in a cloak-room
as the best means of getting rid of it without
leaving a clue.</p>

<p>Having arrived at Wanne at eight o’clock, I
handed my two pieces of luggage in at the cloak-room
window, asking for a separate ticket for
each.</p>

<p>The man behind the counter, to whom I took a
great dislike from that moment, stared at me in
silence for some seconds, until I could no longer
stand it, and started a lame explanation: I
wanted to leave the small bag for a friend of
mine to fetch later on from whom I had borrowed
it in the town about a week ago, name of
Hugo Schmidt. The other I would take away
with me as soon as my business in Wanne was
finished. The fib sounded unconvincing enough
to my own ears. The wooden face of my
antagonist on the other side of the window gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
no indication of thoughts or emotions. All that
mattered really was that he gave me two
tickets, and that I found myself in the street
still unarrested but feeling unaccountably hot.</p>

<p>Walking as briskly as my limp would permit,
I wandered about the streets, diving into a
factory yard here and the hall of an office building
there, as if I were a commercial traveler,
taking good care not to linger long enough for
other people to become interested in me.</p>

<p>All the time I felt uncomfortable and dissatisfied
with my performance at the station and
the pretense I was putting up, and thus it came
about that the photograph of a friend of mine
in Ruhleben disintegrated under my fingers in
my pocket, to be dropped bit by bit into the road,
lest, if I were arrested, the original should get
into trouble.</p>

<p>It was a relief when ten o’clock was past and
train-time approached. I got my portmanteau
from my friend in the cloak-room, who was fortunately
busy with other people, and got into an
empty compartment. Between stations, during
the twenty-minute run, I looked at my maps, to
form an idea of how best to get out of Haltern in
the right direction.</p>

<p>This small town is about half a mile from the
station, which is an important railway junction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I was quite unacquainted with this part of the
province of Westphalia. The maps showed it
as not too thickly populated, with plenty of
woods dotted all over it, and plenty of water.</p>

<p>The train thundered over the big railway
bridge crossing the river Lippe and drew into
the station, and I, feeling pretty good, landed
on the platform with something like a skip and
a jump, until I recollected my leg. Then slowly
I limped after the other people the train had
disgorged. In front of me I could see the
church steeple rising above the roofs of the compact
little town in the middle distance. Half-way
toward it I passed a detachment of English
Tommies sitting on top of a fence, smoking
pipes and cigarettes. About an equal number
of Poilus were standing close to them, laughing
and criticizing the appearance of the passing
women. The only guard I could discover was
leaning sleepily against a tree on the opposite
side of the road. I suppressed an almost overwhelming
desire to exchange greetings, and
passed them instead with a stony stare.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">IN HIDING</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">It was a sunny, warm day, and there was no
difficulty about finding one’s bearings. In
the market-place a sign “To Wesel” directed me
up a narrow street of humble dwellings on my
left. Just outside the town a number of roads
met. Without looking at the directions on a
mile-stone, I surveyed the country before me for
suggestions as to my next move. The most
important thing was to get to cover as quickly
as possible, and to withdraw from the sight of
man. Never mind about striking the right route
now. That could wait until a thorough study of
the maps gave me a better grasp of the situation.
The most favorable-looking road led
past a number of cottages and then ran in a
northwesterly direction between a low range of
hills. A footpath branching off toward a copse
on my left seemed to offer the double attraction
of a solitary walk and a short cut to a hiding-place.
It took me about a hundred yards along
the rear of the cottages, and then rejoined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
parent road at a point where the woods came
down to it.</p>

<p>As soon as a corner of the copse sheltered me,
I gave a last look up and down the deserted
road, and a moment later the branches of the
half-grown firs closed crackling behind me.</p>

<p>Loaded as I was with a thick overcoat and a
heavy bag, I was fairly bathed in perspiration
before I had penetrated sufficiently far into the
thicket to feel safe. The branches were so interlaced
that only the most realistic wormlike
wriggle was effective as a means of propulsion,
and even then progress was accompanied by a
crackling noise which I was anxious to avoid.</p>

<p>Satisfied at last, I stood up and looked about
me. From the pin-pricks of light toward the
east, I concluded that the spot I stood on was
not far from the margin of the copse where it
bordered upon a plowed field. On all other
sides was a dead wall of brown and green. Underfoot
the ground was sopping wet, for the
spring sun had no power as yet to penetrate
down to where the brown needles and a tangle of
black and moldering grass of last year’s
growth would soon be covered by the shoots of
the new spring. Wet and black, the lower
branches of the young trees were things of the
past, but higher up they stretched their arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
heavenward clothed in their dark green needles.
The tops of the firs were glistening like green
amber where they swayed slightly in the clear
sunlight, forming delicate interlacing patterns
beneath the pale spring sky.</p>

<p>Resting and preparing for my night’s walk, or
poring over my maps, I spent the day there. A
mouthful of food now and again was all I could
swallow, for I was parched with thirst. The
fast walk in the warm sun had started it, and the
knowledge that there was no chance of assuaging
it before the small hours of the next morning
made it worse. I had not dared to fill my water-bottle
at any of the stations for fear of being
seen and arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>Most of the day my ears were continually on
the alert, not so much from fear of discovery as
for sounds which might convey useful information.
The road leading past my hiding-place
seemed little used; the rumble of a cart reached
me only very occasionally. From the shrill
cries of playing children, and the cackling of
hens, I surmised the existence of several farmhouses
farther along.</p>

<p>Before lying down I had put on my second set
of underwear and discarded my white shirt, collar,
and tie, for a green woolen shirt and a dark
muffler, which did away with any but neutral col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ors
on my person. Oilskins, oilsilks, overcoat,
food, etc., were to be packed in the knapsack on
breaking camp. Whatever would be wanted
during the march, such as compass, maps, electric
torch, and a small quantity of biscuits and
chocolate, I stowed away in convenient pockets.
The maps I cut into easily handled squares, discarding
all the superfluous parts. When the
sun had disappeared and gloom was gathering
under the trees, I slung the water-bottle from
my belt, the binoculars from my neck, and then
crept to the edge of the copse, there to wait for
the night.</p>

<p>Concealed behind some bushes, I watched the
road, which gradually grew more indistinct.
The roofs of the town, huddled in the hollow,
lost their definite outlines. One after another
lights sprang up behind the windows. The children’s
voices became fewer, then ceased.
Sound began to carry a great distance; the rumble
of a railway train, the far-away barking of a
dog. Twinkling stars came out in the heavens.
It was time to start.</p>

<p>At 8:30 I scrambled out of my hiding-place
and gained the road, where I set my face toward
the west after a last glance at Haltern with its
points of light. Two farmhouses, perfectly
dark even at this early hour of the night, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
lay behind me. Here the forest came down to
the road on my left while fields bordered it on
the right, and, perhaps eighty yards distant, the
wooded hills arose. Whether it was a sort of
sixth sense which gave me warning, I do not
know, but a strong feeling that I was not safe on
the road made me walk over the fields into the
shadow of the trees, from where I could watch
without being seen. My figure had hardly
merged into this dark background, when silently
a shadowy bicycle rider flitted along the road,
going in my direction. He carried no lamp, and
might have been a patrol.</p>

<p>The going on the plowed fields being rather
difficult, I soon grew impatient of my slow progress
and returned to the road, proceeding along
it in perfect serenity henceforth. It rose gradually.
Checking its direction by a glance at the
stars now and again, I soon noticed a decided
turn to the northwest. This proved beyond
doubt that it could not be the turnpike to Wesel,
which throughout its length ran due west.</p>

<p>After perhaps an hour of hard going, a sign-post
loomed ghostly white through the darkness,
to spring into sharp relief in the light from the
torch. “Klein Recken 2½ hours,” it read. A
consultation of the map then showed that I was
on a far more favorable road than I had antici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>pated,
and that a brook flowing close to the
hither side of the village of Klein Recken might
be reached at about midnight, if I kept my speed.
I needed no further inducement.</p>

<p>I was now ascending the last spur of the hills
which had fronted me on coming out of Haltern.
My way lay mostly through woods, with
occasional clearings where the dark outlines of
houses and barns showed against the sky. Only
occasionally was a window feebly lit as if by a
night-light. Often dogs gave warning of my
approach and spread the alarm far and wide.</p>

<p>It was a most glorious night, the sky a velvet
black, the stars of a brilliancy seldom seen in
western Europe. Their luster seemed increased
when I found myself hedged in by a tall
forest through which the road wound as through
a cañon. A bright planet hung fairly low just
in front of me, and in the exuberance of my feelings
I regarded it as my guiding star.</p>

<p>On the ascent the night air was deliciously
cool, not cold, with occasional warmer puffs
laden with the scent of pines, the unseen
branches and sere leaves of which whispered
softly. Seldom have I felt so great a sense of
well-being as I had during the first hours of that
night. Never again while I was in Germany&mdash;whether
in camp, in prison, or on other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ventures&mdash;did I feel quite so happy, so free from all
stress, so safe.</p>

<p>Just before coming to the top of the ridge I
found another sign-post pointing one arm into
the forest as the shortest route to Klein Recken.
The light of the torch revealed a narrow footpath
disappearing into impenetrable blackness.
I eased myself of my knapsack and rested for
ten minutes, eating some biscuits and chocolate,
which made me more thirsty than ever. It must
have been colder than I thought, for on resuming
my burden I found it covered with a thin sheet
of ice.</p>

<p>Striking into the footpath, I found a rather
liberal use of the torch necessary. The path descended
steeply at first, then more gradually.
The tall timber changed to smaller trees and
thickets. An occasional railway train rumbled
in the distance; yet for over an hour the country
was empty of human dwellings. Then several
houses, widely apart, announced the neighborhood
of a village. A tinkling sound made me
lengthen my already swinging stride until I
stood on a stone bridge. The low murmur of
water below was very pleasant in my ears. But
that was not the only sound. Something was
stirring somewhere, but my dry tongue and
throat would not be denied any longer. Clam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>bering
over a barbed-wire fence into a meadow,
I looked for a place from which I could reach
the stream, which had steep banks. Engaged in
tying my water-bottle to my walking-stick to
lower it into the water, I heard footsteps approaching.
The darkness was sufficient concealment,
and I merely kept motionless as two
men crossed the bridge, one of whom, from the
scraps of talk I could distinguish, appeared to
be the village doctor, who was being fetched to
a patient.</p>

<p>When they had gone, I lowered my water-bottle.
It seemed a very long time filling, the
bubbles breaking the surface with a wonderfully
melodious sound. And then I drank and
drank, filled it again, and almost emptied it a
second time. When I turned away, it was hanging
unwontedly heavy against my hip.</p>

<p>In front of me was Klein Recken. The road
I had been following up to now terminated here.
It was miles to the north of where I expected to
be at this time, when I started out, but that much
nearer to the frontier. My plans for the night
had been upset by my getting on this favorable
road, nor could I look at my maps. The use
of the torch so near to habitations was out of
the question. I had a pretty good idea, however,
of what I should have seen, had I dared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>A railway line ran through the village. After
crossing this, I should have to trust to my guiding
star and to my ability to work across-country.</p>

<p>Instead of the level crossing I was looking for,
I came unexpectedly upon a tunnel in a very
high embankment. With bated breath I tiptoed
through, more than half expecting to meet a
sentry on the other side. The footpath which
emerged from it proved an unreliable guide. It
soon petered out and left me stranded in front
of a barbed-wire fence and a ditch. The cross-country
stretch was on.</p>

<p>The going over plowed fields was easy in
comparison, but they formed only a part of the
country I was traveling over. Frequent
patches of forest forced me to skirt them, with
time lost on the other side to make the necessary
corrections. Repeatedly I sank half-way to
my knees into slough and water. Several casts
were often necessary to get round these places,
for, overgrown with weeds, and in the darkness,
the swampy pieces looked like firm meadows.
For a time, a sort of wall formed of rough
stones accompanied me, with marshy ground on
one side and forest on the other. It seemed to
run in all directions. As soon as I lost it, I
came upon it again. I kept going as fast as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
possible all the time; yet hour after hour
passed, and still the bewildering procession of
woods and fields, swamps and meadows continued.</p>

<p>A phenomenon of which I was ignorant at the
time, but which is well known to sailors, kept me
busy conjecturing. It is an impression one gets
at night, on level ground, or at sea, that one is
going decidedly up-hill. In my case this introduced
a disturbing factor into my calculations
as to my position.</p>

<p>After tacking through a forest over checker-board
clearings the meaning of which was hidden
from me, for they were hardly paths or
roads, I came out upon a path, and heard water
bubbling out of the bank on my right. “More
haste less speed. Take it easy,” I murmured
to myself, dropping the haversack. Then I
bent down to the spring and, having drunk as
much as I needed, and eaten a mouthful of food,
I did some of the hardest thinking of my life.</p>

<p>So far as I recollect, my watch showed just
3:20 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> I went minutely over all my movements
since leaving Klein Recken. Although
the road, which I expected would lie across my
course, had not yet materialized, I was confident
that I had kept my direction fairly well. It was
the impossibility of calculating one’s speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
across-country which caused the uncertainty as
to my whereabouts.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was no doubt that a turnpike
was not many miles to the north of me. To
reach it, and thus ascertain my position, meant
leaving the present route to the frontier. With
less than two hours of darkness before the dawn,
which would force me into hiding, the former
factor was of far greater importance than the
latter.</p>

<p>My nerves had been getting a little shaky under
the stress. I had to press my hands to my
head in order to think logically, and to exert all
my will-power to keep my heart steady. Oh,
for a companion! The effort cleared my brain
and soothed me. I was almost cheerful when I
went on.</p>

<p>Opposite a farmhouse, the path divided and
my way became a miry and deeply rutted cart
track. Past another farm, it entered a swampy
meadow through a gate and disappeared. Savage
at being tricked again, I wheeled round to
look for the other fork of the track, but was arrested
by seeing a light in the window of the
farmhouse where a big dog had given the alarm
when I passed. This was the last straw.
Clenching my teeth, I crouched behind the
hedge, an insensate fury making my ears sing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
For the moment, having lost all control of myself,
I was more than ready to meet man or dog,
or both, and fight it out on the spot. But that
feeling passed quickly.</p>

<p>The noise of a door being opened came to my
ears. A lantern was borne from the house and
obscured again. Another door opened, and the
footsteps of a horse sounded on cobbles, followed
by the jingling of harness. Then a cart
started out into the dark. Where a cart could
go there must be a road; so I followed after,
stumbling over ruts and splashing through puddles,
and running when the horse broke into a
trot.</p>

<p>The cart drew up in front of a building, of
which I could see only patches of the front wall
where the lantern light struck. Followed the
noise of heavy things dumped into the vehicle.
Then it started again&mdash;back toward where I was
standing. Thoroughly exasperated, I turned on
my heel and walked back over the road I had
come, careless whether I was seen or not. I
soon drew away, tried to work round in a circle,
and presently came upon a road once more.</p>

<p>What a relief it was to feel even ground
under my feet! A little way farther on, and a
sign-post pointing in opposite directions along
the road, read:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> “Klein Recken 8 Km., Heiden
2 Km.” Out with the map. There was the
road, which I had overlooked entirely so far,
as it was very faintly marked. With satisfaction
I saw that I had kept my direction admirably;
but it was annoying to perceive that
my course had lain parallel to it all the time,
probably never more than a mile away. Making
for the village, only about twenty minutes
ahead, I could in good time reach a desolate,
high plateau, where cover very likely could be
found.</p>

<p>In Heiden, a compact little village, my footfalls
rang loudly in the cobbled streets. There
was no sign of life about the place, and special
precautions seemed entirely superfluous. I
walked past the church and struck right into the
high road I was looking for, which was easily
recognizable by its direction and the fact that
it began immediately to ascend the plateau.</p>

<p>The worst of my troubles over for the night,
the fact that I was tired, not so much muscularly
as mentally, became only too apparent as I
trudged along. I started talking to myself, imitating
tricks of speech of my late companions at
the sanatorium, and making up whole dialogues.
This continued as long as I followed the turnpike
mechanically, although I was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
aware of the absurdity of my behavior and tried
to stop it.</p>

<p>The sky was now paling in the east, and about
two miles out of Heiden I started to look for
cover. For three quarters of an hour I kept
leaving the road for likely-looking woods, always
to find farmhouses concealed behind them.</p>

<p>Several times, while I was standing among
the trees, and peering anxiously about me,
white-robed figures appeared to execute weird
dances between the trunks, only to dissolve into
nothing on my approach to investigate them.
Friends of mine had similar experiences to relate,
when later on we met in prison and
swapped yarns about our adventures.</p>

<p>The light was increasing apace, when a tall
pine wood loomed up on my left. Bursting
through the bushes fringing it, I proceeded a
little way in, until I came to a deep, dry ditch
marking its margin, and fairly effectively concealed
by bushes. I had the fir woods on my
left; on my right was a patch of land bounded
by a wire fence and grown over by small firs and
thornless furze. A little farther up, some of
the furze had been cut and was lying on the
ground. An examination of the stumps showed
them black and weathered; there was no sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of recent work. Beyond the wire fence, and
across a plowed field, a farm lay more than half
concealed in its orchard.</p>

<p>Gathering as much as I could of the furze in
my arms, I carried it to a place where the ditch
was particularly deep and well concealed. Two
trips sufficed to provide me with the necessary
amount. Arranging the furze in the approved
fashion, lengthways and across, I soon had an
excellent spring-mattress in the bottom of the
ditch. Undressing, I donned the dry sweater
next my skin, and put all the garments I had by
me over it, for the air was bitingly cold.</p>

<p>A last deep draft from the water-bottle,
a careful wriggle to get on my couch, and I
fell asleep instantly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I awoke without a start, and with every sense
alert, after barely two hours, wonderfully refreshed
and not in the least stiff. The sun was
low in the sky and shone like a big red disk
through the morning mist. Pale-golden shafts
of light penetrated into the pillared hall underneath
the dark green dome of the majestic firs.
It was very cold, but to me it appeared only
like the refreshing sting of a cold bath. Without
going to sleep again, I lay motionless, every
muscle relaxed, while the sun climbed higher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
As it did so, the air grew warmer, the scent of
the pines became stronger, while the earthy
smell of the ground suggested the new life of
spring and the stirring of sap in the growths
around me.</p>

<p>Toward eleven, an early bumble-bee paid me
a visit of inspection, and took himself off again
after the bungling fashion of his tribe. The
cooing of wood-pigeons close to me assured me
of my perfect solitude. Once a kestrel flashed
across the ditch and disappeared with a startled
twist of wings and tail on catching sight of me.
The roar of guns miles away seemed louder
and louder, but the sound was not near enough
to merit any attention on my part.</p>

<p>When the ditch was in the full light of the
sun, I rolled out of my coverings to spend a
most glorious day in perfect contentment, eating
a little, husbanding my water as well as I
could, smoking, and looking at my maps. The
next night I hoped would see me across the border.
I meant to pass through a village about
four miles down the road, and&mdash;but that does
not matter. What mattered was that I forgot
that the day was Saturday, and that people
would be likely to remain about much longer
than on ordinary week-days.</p>

<p>The shadows were meeting in the shelter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the woods when I worked my way back to the
road. Tiny night-prowlers were already following
their business and either scampered noisily
away, or froze into the immobility of fear,
as my clumsy feet crashed through their domain.
From behind some bushes close to it I
watched the white ribbon of the road until it
was almost blotted out by the darkness, and then
set forth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">FAILURE</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">My water-bottle wanted filling. A spring
bubbling up by the roadside gave me the
opportunity. That was a mile or so down the
road. I had got again into the swinging stride
of the night before, and the few miles to the
village of Vehlen were soon covered. A sudden
turn of the road near it brought me opposite a
building looking like a flour-mill. An electric
light was blazing at its corner. On the other
side of the road its rays were reflected by the
oily ripples on a large pond, the farther side of
which was hidden in the darkness.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strain and loneliness of the last
few days were telling upon me without my
being aware of it. At any rate, I did not realize
that the light was a danger-signal flaunted by
Providence into my very face. It never occurred
to me that on seeing it I ought to get
off the road at once and work around the
village across-country. Instead, with the experience
of last night at the back of my mind,
I held on stubbornly and never realized my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
folly until I was fairly in the main street.</p>

<p>Most of the houses were lighted and a
number of street lamps going. Several people
were passing between houses. It was too late
to turn back when I saw what I had done. Two
old men in front of me, whom I had caught up
with, caused me to adapt my pace to theirs so
as not to pass them. They turned a corner,
I after them, when from the opposite direction
a bicycle appeared. The rays of its lamp
blinded me. I dared not look back when it had
passed, but hurried on as fast as I could short
of running. After an eternity of a few minutes
somebody jumped off a bicycle at my shoulder,
having come up noiselessly from behind. He
touched me.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” An armed soldier stood before
me.</p>

<p>I gave a name.</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p>“I belong to Düsseldorf.”</p>

<p>“So. Where do you come from now?”</p>

<p>“From Borken.”</p>

<p>“But you are not on the road from Borken!”</p>

<p>I knew that, but no other name had occurred
to me. What I ought to have said was “Bocholt,”
I think.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am not bound to follow what you call the
direct road, and, anyway, what do you mean
by stopping me and questioning me in this
fashion?”</p>

<p>“Where are you bound for?”</p>

<p>For want of anything better, I created the
imaginary country house of an imaginary noble.</p>

<p>“Don’t know it,” said the soldier, eyeing me
doubtfully and scratching his head.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd had collected around
us. Additions to it, mostly children, were
shooting full speed round the nearest corners,
as I saw out of the corner of my eye, helm hard
a-port and leaning sideways to negotiate the
turn. But I was already hemmed in by four
or five stalwarts. Outside the crowd a small
man was dancing excitedly up and down demanding
that I be taken before the Amtmann,
the head of the village. This man turned out
to be the village doctor, the cyclist who had
passed me. “What a disagreeable, foxy face
the chap has,” flashed through my mind. The
soldier was obviously still in doubt about me,
but was overruled in spite of all the arguments
I could think of.</p>

<p>With the soldier by my side, two stalwarts
in front and three behind, and surrounded by
the throng, I was marched through the streets.
We drew up before a farmlike building, and po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>litely
but firmly I was urged to enter. We
went into a big room on the ground floor. Two
desks, several chairs and tables, and file cabinets
made up the furniture. A telephone was
attached to the wall next the door.</p>

<p>A young man jumped up from his chair in
front of one of the desks, and he, and those who
had entered with me, regarded me suspiciously
for a moment without speaking. Then the
young man&mdash;he seemed a clerk&mdash;caught sight of
the binoculars half concealed under my coat
lapels. With the shout, “He is a spy!” he
rushed upon me, and with a quick movement of
his hand tore open my coat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Here, keep your dirty paws off me!” I
grunted angrily.</p>

<p>He stepped back. At this moment the Amtmann
came in, a young and gentlemanly looking
chap. My assailant at once collapsed in a chair,
and tried to assume a judicial attitude with
pen in hand and paper in front of him. Then
they searched me, and the fat was in the fire.
There was, of course, no sense in continuing
the bluffing game, when maps, compasses, and
some letters addressed to me in Ruhleben were
on the table. I had carried the latter as additional
evidence of my identity for the British
consul, should I get through. What they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
not find was my British passport. That was
cunningly, I think, and successfully concealed.</p>

<p>The business part of the performance being
over, they became more genial. The Amtmann
asked me whether or not I was hungry. “No.”
Should I like a cup of coffee? “I should, and
a smoke, please.” With the aid of two cups of
coffee and three of my cigarettes, I pulled myself
together as best I might.</p>

<p>The soldier who had stopped me was in the
highest of spirits about the big catch he thought
he had made, and obviously wanted all the credit
to himself. Perhaps he expected the usual leave
granted for the apprehension of fugitive prisoners
of war, and the ten or fifteen marks of
monetary recognition. In his anxiety to establish
his claim, he forgot all about the indecision
and hesitancy he had shown to start with.</p>

<p>“I knew you immediately for an Englander!
That nose of yours!”</p>

<p>I have the most ordinary face and nose,
and I am of no particular type, but I nodded
with deep understanding.</p>

<p>“Where did you intend crossing the frontier?”
he rattled on.</p>

<p>I pointed it out to him on the map lying on
the table.</p>

<p>“You’d never have got across there,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
vouchsafed triumphantly. “In addition to the
ordinary sentries and patrols, there are dogs
and cavalry patrols at that point, and to the
north of it.”</p>

<p>If only I could have got that information under
different circumstances!</p>

<p>“What beautiful maps you’ve got, and what
a fine compass! Would it&mdash;would it&mdash;would
you think me cheeky if I asked you for it as a
memento?”</p>

<p>Considering that it would be lost to me anyway,
I expressed my pleasure at being able to
gratify his desire. And then the Amtmann
gave me to understand that it was time to be
locked up.</p>

<p>The interview at the office had lasted some
time, and the noses which had flattened themselves
against the outside of the windows had
decreased in number. Still, there was a fairly
strong guard of adults and children to accompany
us to the village lockup.</p>

<p>This was a small building consisting only of
one floor. Here I observed for the first time another
small man with sharp features who unlocked
the door. It was, of course, dark about
us, and at this distance it is difficult to determine
what I saw then and what I learned in
the course of the following day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>We entered through a big door into a place
where a fire-engine&mdash;a hand-pump&mdash;was standing.
A door on the left having been unlocked,
the Amtmann and the small man preceded me
through it. The light of their electric torches
revealed a cell, with a sort of bed along one
side, consisting of a straw paillasse on some
raised boards and two blankets rolled up at the
foot of it.</p>

<p>They had left me in possession of my overcoat,
oilskins, oilsilk, and sweater, so I should
be all right, though the night was very cold.
Alone in the cell in pitch darkness, I heard the
key turn in the lock, the footfalls recede, the
outer door close; then all was silent.</p>

<p>As my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness,
I could make out a small window at my right,
shoulder-high, and traversed by the black
streaks of three vertical iron bars. The cell
was so dark that I had the impression of being
in a vast black hall. I took three steps forward
and rapped my nose against the wall. Very
miserable and much disappointed, almost in despair,
I groped to the window and shook the
bars with all my strength. They were firm and
unyielding. Feeling my way to the bed, I put
on all my things, disdaining the blankets, which
felt filthy, then lay down and was soon asleep.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A NEW HOPE</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">I awoke, much refreshed, just before the
clock from the church steeple chimed six.
For some time I lay quiet, groping my way back
into reality. When the recollection of my last-night’s
disaster drifted back into my brain, I
felt almost physically sick with disappointment
and rage, until awakening determination came
to my help. “No use repining. Is there no
way to repair the damage? Hullo! it’s Sunday
to-day. Sunday! A village jail can’t be so
awfully strong! I’ll be moved to-day, though.
Will they take me away in a car? Those gendarmes
aren’t easily fooled! But, after all,
it’s Sunday. Perhaps that’s a reason why
they won’t move me!” The idea took such a
hold on me that I was up in a jiffy.</p>

<p>The cell, as I could see now, was square and
very small, four paces across. The only article
of furniture was the bed, which took up about
one third of the floor space. There was nothing
else in the room. The window was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
wall opposite the bed, the door on the right.
The former was strongly barred, as I knew already.
Moreover, several ladders hung in front
of it along the outside of the wall. The door
seemed fairly strong and was made of rough
boards. So was the ceiling. A beam extended
from above the window to the opposite wall.
The ceiling boards at right angles did not run
through from wall to wall but terminated on
top of the beam, as could be seen from their
different widths on each side of it. Standing
on the bed, I could place my hands flat against
them without stretching my arms to the full.
In one place above it, and near the left wall
looking toward the window, a splinter had come
away from the edge of a board. Although the
wood at that point showed signs of dry-rot, I
did not investigate it thoroughly just then.</p>

<p>It was a great find, I thought at the time,
when I discovered under the bed a big piece of
timber, the sawn-off end of a beam, about three
feet long. To pounce upon it and hide it under
the paillasse was the work of seconds. It would
furnish an excellent battering-ram.</p>

<p>Up to now I had depended upon my ears to
warn me of anybody’s coming. After the discovery
of the battering-ram, I made sure, by
trying to get a glimpse of the next room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
through cracks in the door, that nobody was
watching me. A part of the fire-engine could
be seen, and on it a clean cup and saucer.
“Somebody must have been in that room to-day!
Nobody would have placed it there last
night. Besides, I didn’t see anybody carrying
anything. Couldn’t have been done while I
was awake. Better go slow!”</p>

<p>Outside the window was a kitchen-garden with
some fruit-trees. To the right, the corner of a
house and a pigsty with a solitary undersized
occupant terminated the view. My horizon was
bounded by the roofs of a few houses which
stood behind trees.</p>

<p>It was past seven o’clock when I heard the
key turn in the outer door. Soon the door of
my cell flew open, and in marched the short,
sharp-featured man of the night before, with
a pot of coffee, a cup and saucer, and something
done up in paper, which turned out to be
excellent bread and butter. Butter, mind you!
With him entered a very young soldier, who
nonchalantly sat down on my bed to survey me
gravely. Around the opening of the door clustered
the elder boys of the village, pushing and
straining. Behind them were the girls, giggling
and whispering nervously. All devoured me
with their eyes. In the rear were the small fry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
They overflowed into the street, where the urchins,
feeling perfectly safe from the bad man
inside, indulged in catcalls and disparaging
shouts at my expense, while I had breakfast.
I chatted the while with the man whom I shall
call the warder, although he probably had many
functions in the village. My efforts to obtain
information from him as to whether or not I
was likely to be taken away that day proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>When my visitors had left me, I remembered
that, experienced jailbird as I had become since
the beginning of the war, I had a duty to perform&mdash;a
scrutiny of the walls of the cell for
any records former occupants might have left
there. This leaving of inscriptions seems to be
“the correct thing” among German prisoners&mdash;criminals,
I mean. They are not always nice
but invariably interesting, particularly under
the circumstances in which they are read. The
walls of my abode had been recently whitewashed,
and there was only one inscription:
“André&mdash;[I forget the surname] evadé Avril
2me 1916, repris Avril 3me 1916.” Thus
a fellow-fugitive had been here only the previous
day.</p>

<p>I very badly wanted my morning smoke, and
unexpectedly I had found two cigarettes in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
pockets, but there were no matches; and I had
been warned that smoking was not permitted.
A woman was walking about in the garden at
this time. I took her to belong to the house
whose corner I could see; she was probably the
wife of the owner. I intended to appeal to her
compassionate spirit. After a time she was
joined by an elderly woman, perhaps her
mother. Although they did not show obvious
interest in me, yet they kept passing in front
of my window. At last I addressed them,
whereupon they stopped with alacrity. The
elder woman was certainly talkative. She
pitched into me at once, going over the whole
register of my sins as an Englishman as conceived
by the German mind, and telling me what
a disgusting lot of robbers, thieves, and murderers
we were. As soon as she had got it off
her chest, she became rather friendly. “You’d
be in Holland now, if you hadn’t been taken last
night.”</p>

<p>“Surely not,” with a puzzled frown. “I
thought I’d have another two-days’ walk from
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It’s only a four-hours’ walk by
the road into Holland from here.”</p>

<p>“In this direction?” I pointed east, into
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, over there. You go through &mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;, then take the &mdash;&mdash; road on the right. It’s
not more than four hours, is it?” turning to her
daughter, who nodded.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of your telling me now when
I am behind the bars again?” I groaned. Ingratiatingly:
“Could you oblige me with a
match? I am dying for a smoke.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t allowed to smoke!” severely.
Then they left me.</p>

<p>For a time small boys kept looking in at the
window. Their advent was always heralded by
the sound of a scramble, from which I gathered
that there must be a fence or a gate between the
building I was in and the house on my right.
Sometimes they were chased away incontinently
by somebody I could not see. That any attempt
at breaking out would have to lead through the
garden was a foregone conclusion. The other
side of the building was on the public street.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock the warder appeared, and
I managed to be let out, mainly to have a look
around. When we returned, the Amtmann was
waiting for me. The first thing he did was to
search me for the two cigarettes. The women
had split on me! Then I tried to find out
whether I was to be moved that day, but could
not get a satisfactory answer. This made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rather hopeful that the cell would have to harbor
me for another night. Of course, I professed
myself most anxious to be sent off, which
was natural. The sooner the military authorities
should take me in charge, the sooner I
should know my punishment and get it over. I
was careful to explain all this. Finally, the
Amtmann asked me whether or not I wanted
any of the food he had taken from me. The
answer was in the affirmative. But although he
repeated this question later in the day, and
promised to send me the sausage, I never got it.
My request for something to read he granted
by sending me some German weeklies called
<em>Die Woche</em> (“The Week”).</p>

<p>Then he left me, only to reappear at 11:30.
This time he was very solemn, and asked me to
give him my word of honor that I was not an
English officer. Obviously one was at large in
Germany; I could not suppose that it was a shot
at random. With feeling I assured him that I
was not an officer and never had been one. My
questions regarding this interesting subject fell
on deaf ears.</p>

<p>The Amtmann’s parting words excited me
greatly. He regretted that I should have to
spend another night in his village, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
could not arrange for an escort on Sunday. It
was difficult to hide my exultation over this
bit of news, but I believe I managed to look dejected
and resigned.</p>

<p>Soon after the Amtmann had gone, the warder
brought me my dinner in a dinner-pail. He
left it with me and disappeared. The food was
certainly the best I had ever received from German
authorities at any time. The pot was full
of excellent potatoes in brown, greasy onion
gravy. A decent-sized piece of hot, home-made
sausage lay on top. I was very hungry, but so
excited that I was half-way through the mess before
I realized that I was merely swallowing it
down without tasting a bit of it. That was
sheer ingratitude, and thereafter I went ahead
slowly, thoroughly enjoying it. The pot was
empty far too soon; a second edition would
have been very acceptable. I complimented the
warder on the excellent fare in his prison.</p>

<p>“I told my wife about you,” he acknowledged,
“and she said we ought to give you a decent
dinner anyway.”</p>

<p>When I had finished I thought the time favorable
to begin operations. After a substantial
Sunday dinner&mdash;there was evidently no
shortage of food in that part of Germany as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
yet&mdash;the village was bound to be more or less
somnolent. Indeed, no sound was to be heard
from the street.</p>

<p>The first thing was to make a thorough inspection
of the ceiling. If one could get into the
loft the roof would offer little resistance, it
being, as I had seen, tiled in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Where the splinter had broken off, two boards
appeared affected by dry-rot, a narrow one and
a wider one next to it. Tentatively I pushed
against the narrow one near the end which was
nailed to the beam. There was some spring
there, not the firm resistance of a sound board
well nailed home. Under the slowly increased
pressure it suddenly gave with a creak, and a
shower of splinters and dust came down upon
me and the bed. I could now look into the loft
and see the under side of the tiles. Directly
in line with my eyes was a hole where a tile
had lost its upper half. This would be the
place to attack, once through the ceiling.</p>

<p>In the meantime the sun shone through another
hole which I could not see, and, through
the crack upon my bed. To pull the board back
into its original position had no effect. Where
there had been a narrow crack in the morning
another splinter had become detached, and there
was the scintillating beam of light cleaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
path through the dust motes, a traitorous tell-tale.
After a moment’s thought, I rolled my
oilsilks into a long sausage and shoved it past
the raised board into the loft in such a fashion
that it would roll over the crack when the board
was lowered. It worked, and after a critical
inspection I decided that none but an exceptionally
observant individual would ever
notice that the ceiling had been tampered with.</p>

<p>All this had not taken very long. Absolute
silence brooded over the place. Fearing that
the narrow board might be insufficient to let me
into the loft, I tried to get the wider one next to
it loose. When it resisted the pressure of my
hands, the battering-ram was brought into play,
with the overcoat wrapped round the end of it
to deaden the noise. Using it with discretion, I
could make no impression. So I left it at that.</p>

<p>Having removed all traces of my work from
the bed and the floor, I stood near the door and
kicked my heels against it. This I did to have
some explanation, should anybody have heard
the battering-ram at work. Then I quieted
down, resolving not to do any more until soon
after the next visit.</p>

<p>I was now quite convinced that I should get
out of the prison during the night. My one
anxiety was for the weather to keep fine. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a fair idea of how to proceed as long as I could
keep my direction. Without a compass I was
dependent upon the stars. There was no sign
of a change in the sky; nevertheless, I kept an
unceasing and apprehensive watch upon what I
could see of it.</p>

<p>At three o’clock the Amtmann came back:
“The people next door complain that you disturbed
them in the night. There were thumping
and bumping noises coming from this cell.”
I had slept almost like a log through the night.
The involuntary expression of astonishment on
my face at this complaint was a more convincing
answer than I could have made verbally to the
Amtmann, who was watching me narrowly all
the time. I protested, of course, and then volunteered
the information that I had been kicking
my heels against the door a short time ago,
apologizing with a contrite mien.</p>

<p>“Oh, these people always seem to imagine
things!” was his reply, wherewith he left me.
I thought I had got well out of it. Obviously
there was a misunderstanding, and the noise
which had attracted the attention of “the people
next door” was that of my efforts an hour or
so ago.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the warder brought me coffee
and bread and butter. He had a small retinue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with him. When I had finished, I asked him to
fill the coffee-pot with water and leave it with
me. Not only was I very thirsty; I wanted to
absorb as much moisture as I could while I had
the chance.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone I got on the bed again.
The sun had now traveled far enough to the
west to make the roll of oilsilks superfluous.</p>

<p>If, as I believed, the cell wall was an outer
one, the board could now be fast only at the end
above it. Applying my strength at the other
end near the beam ought to give me a tremendous
leverage, which should force it loose with
little effort. It resisted, however, until I fancied
I could hear my joints crack with the exertion.
The strain lasted a few seconds; then
the board came away above the wall with
a rending crash. Simultaneously something
heavy fell to the ground on the other side. The
sound of it striking the floor, and the slant of
the board, revealed the existence of a third
room in the building, across which it had extended
to the real outer wall of the prison, and
at the same time explained its strong resistance
to my efforts.</p>

<p>With thumping heart and bated breath I listened
for any suspicious sounds from beyond the
wall or from the street, but nothing happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Still the board, which now ought to have moved
easily, resisted. Getting my head into the loft,
I found it littered with heavy lumps of metal
and plenty of broken glass, the remnants of old
street-lamp standards. Some of the metal
things projected over the opening; as soon as I
had pushed them away the board moved up and
down freely.</p>

<p>This was all I dared do at the moment in
preparation for the escape. The rest could easily
be accomplished by the sense of touch in the
night. For the present, the board had to be
fitted back into place. I accomplished that, or
nearly so, and trusted to the blindness of the
average mortal for my safety.</p>

<p>When I had removed the dust and splinters
from my bed, and everything looked in order, I
saw the woman from next door walking in the
garden. I was quite taken aback, and watched
her for some time, but she seemed unconcerned
enough. She could hardly have seen me except
by putting her face close to the window, for
the eaves projected a considerable distance beyond
the walls, and were not more than eight
feet from the ground. Consequently it was
never light in the cell, and less so now when the
sun was nearing the sky-line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>About half an hour afterward she came to
my window, bringing two girls with her, who
obviously had come on purpose to see the wild
Englishman. The taller was a strapping,
Junoesque maiden with apple-red cheeks and
considerable assurance. Her friend, a foil to
her, was more of a Cinderella, gray, middle-sized,
reticent, but pleasant to look upon, and
with intelligent eyes and a humorous mouth.
She said never a word during her friend’s lively
chat with me, only gurgling her amusement now
and then.</p>

<p>When they had gone I continued my intermittent
watch of “the little patch of blue that
prisoners call the sky.” Gradually it changed
to a rosy hue, then the color faded, and a few
stars began to twinkle feebly.</p>

<p>With the approach of evening the temperature
had gone down, and the overcoat had become
a comfort. To my surprise, an inner
pocket, crackling ever so little, gave up a piece
of map not larger than my hand. It was from
the more useless map I had bought, but the
most important part of it, the only piece I had
kept when setting out from Haltern. Being
printed on thin, unbacked paper, it had escaped
the attention of my captors the more easily as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they had found the other complete map in my
coat pocket. It did not tell me much more than
I knew already, but, kept before me until darkness
fell, it undoubtedly helped me visualize the
country I was walking through later on.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">BREAKING PRISON</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Before I made a move I was going to
wait until the probability of a surprise
visit should have passed. Such a visit I expected
at about eleven o’clock, for at that time
the Amtmann would probably go home from
wherever he was drinking beer, and on his way
would have a look at me. To give my jailers an
extra hour to surprise me in, was again only
ordinary precaution.</p>

<p>Once in the loft, I was going to take off as
many tiles as I must to get through the roof
into the garden, from there into the street,
and out of the village in any direction. In the
country it would most likely prove necessary to
work round the village at a safe distance in
order to strike a certain turnpike. Several
miles along it a brook crossing the road was an
indication that I should have to look out for a
third-class cart track. Some distance along
this a railway, and, shortly after, a first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
road, could be taken as evidence that the frontier
was within four miles, and that I had entered
the danger zone.</p>

<p>When it was too dark to continue the study of
the scrap of map, I lay down, but was too excited
to go to sleep. Slowly the hours and quarter-hours,
chimed by the church, dragged past.
As I expected, just after eleven o’clock the Amtmann
entered with the warder. “Why! aren’t
you asleep yet?” he asked. I protested that the
rattle of the key had awakened me. They left.
Half an hour after the warder came in again,
said something, and disappeared. At 12:15 I
burst into action.</p>

<p>Feeling for the sweater and oilsilks, which lay
ready to hand, I rolled them into a bundle.
I did the same with my jacket, waistcoat, and
underclothes, after having stripped to the waist,
the better to get through the narrow opening in
the ceiling. Next, I folded the paillasse and
propped it against the wall at the foot of the
bed. Standing on it, I lifted the loose board
and with a jerk of my wrists flung it free. I
shoved the two bundles of clothes up, first feeling
for an unencumbered space of floor, then levered
myself after them.</p>

<p>Arms extended, and with a careful shuffle of
my feet, lest I should step on some glass or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
metal object, I gained the spot where one or
two stars glimmered through the hole in the
roof.</p>

<p>Grasping the remaining half of the broken
tile, I twisted it out as carefully as I could, not
without causing a grating noise, which sounded
loud in the absolute silence. After some difficulty
I drew it through the enlarged hole and,
again making sure that the floor was clear, deposited
it carefully. The next tile gave greater
trouble. It being entire, the ends of the superimposed
ones had to be lifted to allow of its
withdrawal. When I straightened up, in order
to attack the third in the row, I was startled by
the sound of a low-voiced conversation close
to me and apparently on the same level.</p>

<p>The natural impulse was to keep quiet, which
I did. I waited. The even voices went on.
Carefully I pushed my head outside and looked
about. In the gable of the house on the right,
and only about ten yards away, was a small
window. The sound of murmured speech
floated through the open panes directly toward
me from the dark room behind. I took it to be
the bedroom of the farmer and his wife, and remembering
their complaint about my having
been noisy the night before, I cursed the ill
chance which had made this one German farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&mdash;one,
surely, in ten thousand&mdash;fond of fresh air
in his sleeping-chamber.</p>

<p>The bitterly cold night air was streaming
over my naked shoulders while I stood waiting
for the people to go to sleep. Soon the
talk ceased, but I gave them a liberal amount
of time before I continued my labors.</p>

<p>When I had taken out three tiles in the first
row, those in the next and the next again were
quickly removed. The opening was now sufficiently
large, but the two exposed laths running
through it did not leave too much space between
them for a man of my size to clamber through.</p>

<p>Stepping back to get my clothes, I misjudged
the distance, which was small&mdash;a step or two
only&mdash;and almost fell through the hole in
the floor. I saved myself only by quickly shifting
my weight from one foot to the other, which
touched something soft. With a thud one of
my bundles fell back into the cell. Fortunately
it was the oilsilks and sweater; unfortunately
the piece of map was in the pocket of the former.
I did not go after them, but left them where they
had fallen, and slipped into my clothes as
quickly as the want of light and space would
permit. This done, it was only a matter of
great care and unusual contortions to get my
somewhat bulky person through the laths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>At last I stood on the lower of the two I had
exposed, with the night wind soughing over me.
Doubtfully, I surveyed the expanse of roof at
my feet. How to get across it was the question.
Sliding over the tiles meant making a tremendous
noise, quite apart from the danger of possible
injury. If they were removed one by one,
what was to be done with them? Should I
chuck them into the garden as they came off the
laths? I had it! Why not repair the roof
above me as I demolished it in my descent?</p>

<p>My sense of humor was rather tickled at the
idea. To imagine the faces of the Amtmann
and the warder when they were trying to reconstruct
“the crime” was exceedingly funny.
It made me use some extra and unnecessary
care as I replaced the tiles on the laths above
me, taking them, always two and two, from
those below.</p>

<p>In a very short time I was standing on the
last lath. I was in the denser shadow of the
roof now, and the eight feet from the ground
might have been eight thousand for all I could
see of it. This made me hesitate, since a miscalculation
of the distance might easily have
meant a jar or a sprain. Without a sound, however,
I landed on a soft garden bed.</p>

<p>A few moments after I was at the gate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
over, and in the street. A solitary street lamp
was burning here and there; not a soul was in
sight. In the shadow of the wall I stooped to
take off my boots and socks. As far as I recollect,
I got out of the village like a streak of
greased lightning. In reality I probably walked
with due caution. I did not stop until I found
myself in a dark lane outside, where I put on
my boots. It was now 1:15.</p>

<p>The news of my escape would spread, I was
sure, like wildfire through the country, and a
hue and cry would soon be raised. Every man
Jack who could spare the time would make one
of a searching party. For such a thing to happen
in a small community was bound to create
a far greater stir than among the more sophisticated
inhabitants of even a middle-sized town.
I had received a hint that police dogs were kept
in Vehlen. This might have been bluff, but it
was not safe to bet on it. To put as much distance
between me and the pursuers was my only
chance.</p>

<p>To do that I had to find the turnpike I have
spoken of. As far as I knew, it entered Vehlen
from the west. South of and parallel to it was
a secondary railway track.</p>

<p>As soon as a sufficient expanse of sky was visible
for me to take bearings, which was impos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>sible
in the lane on account of big trees on each
side, I found that I should have to pass around
the southern side of Vehlen to get to the desired
point. This would prove difficult and
wasteful of my most precious commodity, time,
as an extensive copse and generally unfavorable
country intervened. The seemingly bolder
course of walking back through the village had
decided advantages and was at this hour hardly
dangerous. Off came my boots again, and at a
dog-trot, which increased to a fast sprint in
front of a public house with a drunken voice issuing
through the window, I crossed the southern
part of the village. I did not happen to
come upon the turnpike as I had hoped. On
taking bearings after this second traverse of
the village I found it lying northeast of me and
therefore concluded that both railway and road
were to be looked for in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>“Northwest now, and damn the wire fences.”
It was difficult going at first, the country, criss-crossed
by fences and ditches, enclosing swampy
meadows. Due north was easier walking and
would do nearly as well. A path gave me a
rest. It was so heavenly easy to follow. Bang!
I stumbled over a rail. “Hurrah, the railway!
Now for the road!”</p>

<p>Again across-country, I pushed on as fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
as I could in my favored direction. It was not
very fast, for the difficulties were enough to
drive one crazy. Swampy meadows, ditches,
barbed-wire fences, woods, copses, but never a
bit of easy ground. Soon I was wet to the hips.
Branches plucked at my garments or slashed
me across the face; barbed-wire fences grasped
and retained pieces of cloth as I got over them;
the sides of ditches caved in under my feet
and, having jumped short in consequence, I
landed half in the water; and ever and anon the
village church tolled another quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>It was an absolute nightmare. Panting and
breathless, I got up after one of my many
tumbles. It was in an open kind of wood. My
soaked clothes were dripping, yet I felt warm
with the speed of my flight. Then the sensation
of being utterly lost came over me, the danger-signal
that the nerves are giving way. Luckily
I had sense enough to recognize it as such, and
promptly sat down in half an inch of water,
pretending that I was in no hurry whatever.</p>

<p>I tried to reason out the situation. If the
road were where I sought it, I should have come
to it long before. My maps were unreliable in
small details. Suppose the road crossed to the
south of the railway, some distance outside Vehlen,
instead of in the village as marked. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
that case I had started from a point north of
the road and south of the railway. Better go
back to the railway and follow it west until I
came to the point of intersection.</p>

<p>I turned due south, feeling better for the rest,
and ten minutes later jumped the ditch along
the turnpike. The night was very fine, the road
hard and smooth. My footsteps rang so loudly
that it was difficult to tell whether anybody was
coming up behind me or not. For the third
time I took off my boots and socks, and walked
the rest of the night with bare feet. It was
simply glorious to be able to step out. The
exercise soon sent the blood tingling and warming
through my body, which had become chilled
during my rest in the woods. My clothes were
drying apace; I hardly knew now that they
were wet. My toes seemed to grip the ground
and lever me forward. It was good to be alive.</p>

<p>After I had traversed the considerable belt of
isolated farms surrounding a village, the country
became quite uninhabited for a time, until a
solitary inn appeared on my right. Here another
road joined from the north, and at the
point of meeting stood a big iron sign-post.
“Dangerous corner ahead! Motors to slow
down,” I managed to decipher, clinging to the
pointing arm. Soon after, the brook was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
crossed on a stone bridge. Not being thirsty, I
did not stop, but went forward until I came to
a track on my right. Posts were planted across
it at measured intervals, as if it had been closed
to wheeled traffic some time before, yet there
were fresh cart ruts running parallel to it. The
country was flat, with plenty of cover, and
empty. I kept checking the direction of the
path, which meandered about a little, and found
it one or two points more westerly than I had
expected. This worried me a little. Its angle
with the road shown on the map was so small,
however, that I could not attach undue importance
to it. At the worst, it meant striking the
frontier ultimately a mile or two farther south,
increasing the distance by that much from the
point the soldier had so triumphantly warned
me against the night before.</p>

<p>In due course I came across another railroad
and a turnpike. A quarter of a mile to the
north a church steeple was faintly outlined
against the sky, indicating a village. This tallied
fairly well with my expectations. When
crossing over the line of rails I had entered the
danger zone, where sentries and patrols might
be expected anywhere. Probably the frontier
was no more than three miles ahead, and might
be nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of proceeding along the road, I walked
at about two hundred yards to one side over
plowed fields. It hurt my feet until I thrust
them hastily into my boots without troubling
about the socks.</p>

<p>The sky was paling faintly in the east. It was
high time to disappear into some thicket, like
the hunted animal I was.</p>

<p>Behind a windmill and a house on my right
the outline of dark woods promised cover.
There was no possibility now of picking and
choosing; I had to take what I could find.
What there was of it was the reverse of satisfactory.
Most of the ground was swampy.
The trees and bushes, which seemed to offer excellent
places for concealment while it was dark,
moved apart with the growing light, while I
grew more anxious.</p>

<p>At last I found a wood composed of small
birches and pines, and some really magnificent
trees. Several paths ran through it. Fairly in
the center they left a sort of island, a little more
densely studded with trees than the rest, and
with plenty of long heather between them. This
must have been about five o’clock.</p>

<p>The heather was sopping wet with dew, and I
did not care to lie down in it just then. Instead,
although it was already fairly light, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
scouted around, trusting for safety to the early
hour and my woodcraft.</p>

<p>At the northern end of the woods I found
signs of recent clearing work, warning me to
keep away from there. Farther on, a dense
patch of saplings would have made an excellent
lair, had it not been for the ground, which was
almost a quagmire. On its farther side a cart
road would give me a start on the following
night. I did not lie down in the wet heather
when I had returned to my lair, but pressed
myself into a small fir-tree. I was tired, and
soon very cold. Yet I had rather a good time.
I was a little proud of myself, and picturing the
faces of my late captors in Vehlen when they
found the bird flown, which would happen about
this time, was the best of fun. I chuckled to
myself about the joke whenever my head, falling
forward, awoke me from a semi-stupor.</p>

<p>The sun took some time to clear the morning
mist from the face of the country. After
that, it grew warmer quickly. It must have
been a rare morning, but I was past appreciating
it. Ere yet the heather was near being dry,
I let myself fall forward into a nice, springy
tuft which my dim vision had been gloating
over for some time. I believe I was asleep before
I reached the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>My sleep was so profound that I had no sense
of the lapse of time when I awoke. As far as
the temperature went, it might have been a day
in the latter part of May, instead of the 5th of
April. From the altitude of the sun it appeared
to be between ten and eleven o’clock. Children
and chickens kept up their usual concert not far
away. The sound of axes came from the clearing
close by. I felt quite warm and comfortable,
particularly after I had taken off my boots
and placed them and my socks in the sun to dry.
Neither hunger nor thirst assailed me during
the day, although the afternoon coffee and
bread and butter of the previous day had been
the last food to pass my lips. Sleep stole over
me softly now and again, so softly, indeed, that
wakefulness merged into slumber and slumber
into wakefulness without sensation. Awake, I
was as alert as ever; asleep, utterly unconscious.
I am quite unable to say when or how often this
happened, so swiftly did the one change into the
other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the day appeared intolerably
long. When the sun was still some distance
above the horizon, I became so restless that I
had to move about in the confined space I permitted
myself. The breaking and trimming&mdash;with
fingers, nails, and teeth&mdash;of a stout sapling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
into a heavy staff, jumping-pole and, perhaps,
weapon, occupied part of the time. Then the
fidgeting started again. I was eager to do
something. The decision was so near. It had
to come that night. The weather, still fine, was
breaking. I felt it in my bones. Without the
stars nothing could be done; without food, and
particularly without water, and with only the
clothes I stood up in, I should not last through
a period of wet weather.</p>

<p>I did not feel apprehensive. On the contrary,
I had a splendid confidence that all would go
well. The Dutch border could not well be more
than three miles away. I had to proceed across-country,
of course, away from roads, certainly
never on them, to pass successfully the sentries
and patrols, who very likely would concentrate
the greater part of their attention upon them.
However, it would not do to depend on being
safe anywhere. As a good deal of my time
would have to be devoted to avoiding them, I
might find it difficult to keep an accurate course,
even if other circumstances did not force me to
alter it considerably. All this had to be considered
and certain safeguards planned. For
those of my readers who are interested in the
technique of my endeavors I would add that I
expected to find a railroad track which ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
parallel to my proposed course on my left, presumably
a mile or two off, and a road entering
Holland about three miles to the north of me,
which in an extreme case would prevent my going
hopelessly astray.</p>

<p>At last the sun touched the sky-line. Before
it was quite dark, but after the voices of children
and fowls and the sounds of work in the woods
had ceased, my restlessness forced me to do
something. I sneaked along the paths and into
the thicket of saplings I had discovered in the
morning, there to ensconce myself close to the
road. Once a girl and a soldier in animated
conversation passed me, while ever so gradually
twilight deepened into darkness.</p>

<p>When the night was as black as could be
hoped for, I walked a hundred yards or so along
the road, bent double and with every sense alert.
Then a path on my right led me through tall
woods. Coming into the open, I corrected my
course, and not long after I was stopped by a
deep ditch, almost a canal. Its banks showed
white and sandy in the starlight; on the side
nearest me was a line of narrow rails. Some
tip-over trucks were standing on them, and a
few lay upturned on the ground. I remember
bending down, in order to feel whether or not
the rails were smooth on top, a sign of recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
use, but straightened immediately. Since I
should be either in Holland, or a prisoner, or
dead before the morning, these precautions
seemed superfluous.</p>

<p>The ditch threw me out of my course. Walking
along it, I noticed a triangular sheen of light
in the sky bearing northwest. It looked as if it
were the reflex of a well-illuminated place miles
ahead. I took it to be the first station in Holland
on the railway from Bocholt. Later I was
able to verify this.</p>

<p>When I got to the end of the ditch, I struck
out across the flat country toward the light.
It took me some time to extricate myself from a
swamp. In trying to work around it, with an
idea of edging in toward a railway line which I
knew to be entering Holland somewhere on my
left, I suddenly came upon a road running
northwest. I left it quicker than I had got on
it, walking parallel to it over plowed land and
keeping it in sight. Shortly after, I passed between
two houses, to see another road in front
of me running at right angles to the former.</p>

<p>I crouched in the angle between the two roads,
trying to penetrate the darkness, and listening
with all my might. I could see no living thing,
and all was silent. Just across from me a structure,
the nature of which I could not make out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
held my gaze. I waited, then jumped across the
road into its shadow. It now resolved itself
into an open shed, with a wagon underneath.
Again I listened and looked, with my back toward
Holland, watching the two houses I had
passed, and nervously scanning the road.</p>

<p>Far down it a small dog began to bark. Not
taking any notice of it at first, I was in the act
of starting across a field covered knee-high with
some stiff growth, when it occurred to me that
the barking sounded like an alarm, of which I
could not be the cause.</p>

<p>Gaining the shelter of the shed again, and
straining my ears, I became aware of distant
and approaching footsteps, regular and ominous.
I ducked into the ditch, crawling half
under the floor of the shed, and waited. When
the sound was only about a yard from me, the
helmet, the head, the up-slanting rifle muzzle,
and the shoulders of a patrol became outlined
against the sky. He walked on and was swallowed
up by the darkness. His footsteps grew
fainter, died away.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” I thought. “This road must
be close to the border. It runs parallel to it.
Maybe I am through the sentry lines.” I
pushed on, very much excited, yet going as carefully
as I could. A barbed wire and ditch were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
negotiated. A patch of woodland engulfed
me. Going was bad on account of holes in the
ground; my instinct was for rushing it, and difficult
to curb.</p>

<p>Three shallow ditches side by side! I felt
them with my hand to make sure they were not
merely deeply trodden paths. “This must be
the frontier!”</p>

<p>I was shaking with excitement and exultation
when I started forward again. My leg went
into a hole, and I fell forward across a dry piece
of wood, which exploded underneath me with a
noise like a pistol shot. I scrambled to my feet,
listened, and walked on.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">CAUGHT AGAIN!</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">“Halt!” The command came like a
thunderclap and shook me from head to
foot. Yet I did not believe that it could mean
anything but a Dutch sentry. I stopped and
tried to locate the man, who, from the sound of
his voice, must be very close. I could not see
him.</p>

<p>“Come here, and hold up your hands!”</p>

<p>I did so and stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Here, here!” The voice was almost at my
elbow. Then I saw the white patch of a face
above a bush. He came up to me, putting his
pistol muzzle in my stomach.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>I was a bit dizzy and shaken, but not quite
done yet.</p>

<p>“Who are <em>you</em>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’m a frontier guard.”</p>

<p>“Dutch or German?” I could not see his
uniform.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>“German!”</p>

<p>I groaned aloud; then: “What the &mdash;&mdash; are
you stopping me for? What are you doing
here, anyway? Leave me alone; I’m on Dutch
soil.”</p>

<p>For answer he stepped back, saw the cudgel
in my upraised hand, and said sharply, “Drop
that stick.” I obeyed. He whistled, and got
an answer from close by, followed by the breaking
of branches and footsteps, as somebody else
moved toward us. My captor put his automatic
into his pocket, keeping his hand on it.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded again.</p>

<p>“That has nothing whatever to do with you.
I crossed the frontier about fifty yards down
there. Good night!”</p>

<p>“Stop! You’re over an hour from the frontier
yet.”</p>

<p>For a moment I wondered whether I could get
my weight into a blow on his jaw and make a
break for it; but, as I swung slightly forward,
lowering my left a little at the same time, I reflected
that I could not possibly tell whether he
was in reach; it was too dark. Now I believed
that I was still far from the frontier. Even if I
could down him, there was the second man
close by. And if a bullet did not bring me
down, they could easily catch me in a race,
knowing the country as I did not, or bring any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
number of soldiers about my ears. If I were
caught after having struck him, it would merely
mean a blank wall and a firing party. Not good
enough!</p>

<p>All this passed quickly through my mind, the
ideas being only half formed. In the long days
of solitary confinement, by which I expiated my
offense, I sat in judgment upon myself again
and again, every time condemning myself for a
slacker. But I knew much more about the actual
position later than at the moment of capture,
and when one is brooding in cells, ready
to barter half one’s remaining life for a glimpse
of the open, it is difficult to come to a just judgment.
To-day I cannot see that I could have
done anything but give in. Had I had money
on me I should have tried offering a bribe, but
I had not even a farthing piece in my pocket.
The “noes” had it.</p>

<p>My two captors took me between them and
marched me off for some time along wood-paths.
The reaction had set in now, and my senses were
dulled. I kept stumbling and falling until they
took my arms, when we made better progress.</p>

<p>“Did I come straight toward you or what?”
I asked dully, after a time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>“No. We were close to the place we got you
at. I heard something, and walked toward the
sound. Then I saw you,” was the reply of the
first man.</p>

<p>After an indefinite time, we struck the railway
and turned down it toward Germany. We
walked and walked. I was beginning to collect
my thoughts, and with them my suspicions of
foul play were returning, when we were challenged.</p>

<p>A sentry flashed his torch over us. In its
light I perceived for the first time that my captors
were in civilian clothes, without badge or
any sign of officialdom. This, and the fact that
we had picked up the sentry only after walking
some time in the direction toward Germany, increased
my perplexity.</p>

<p>I had been dully aware of a strong light in
front of us. It was from the headlights of a
train standing in a small station. In front of it
we passed over a level crossing, and approached
an inn opposite.</p>

<p>They took me into a bar-room. At a table on
one side of the bar sat a soldier in the uniform
of what the Germans call “a sergeant-major-lieutenant,”
a Catholic priest, and a civilian,
who turned out to be mine host. The sentry
reported to the soldier while the old priest made
me sit down at their table. The officer did not
seem to like this arrangement at first, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
padre took no notice of him. He asked me in
English whether I was hungry and thirsty. I
pleaded guilty to both counts, and the nice old
man forthwith ordered beer and sandwiches for
me, telling me the while in bad English that he
had been to the Jesuit College in Rome, where
he had picked up his knowledge of the language
from Irishmen.</p>

<p>In the meantime my captors were regaling
themselves at the bar. Turning to them, the
padre suddenly asked, “Where did you get
him?” “Near &mdash;&mdash;,” was the answer from the
first man. “But&mdash;but&mdash;but that’s <em>very</em> near
the frontier,” stammered the priest, with a look
of astonishment on his face. “No, no,” chorused
the assembled company, as if acting on instructions,
“that’s still an hour from the
frontier,” using exactly the words my captors
had used in the woods. I stopped eating for a
time. I felt physically sick. Only to imagine
that I had won through, actually got over the
frontier, as I began firmly to believe now, to be
tricked back!</p>

<p>The food and the beer had given me fresh
strength. When I was told that it was time to
go, I felt more or less indifferent. We passed
along a road, the two civilians in front, the soldier
behind, and I in the middle, occupied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
my own thoughts and only answering with a
grim cheerfulness such questions as were addressed
to me.</p>

<p>Here I made my second grave mistake, counting
the attempt at passing through Vehlen as
the first. Had I kept alert for “something to
turn up,” I could not have failed to see that we
were marching along the road which I had
crossed some time before, and passing the same
shed. Had I noticed it then, instead of the next
morning, I should have known where the guard-room
was in which I spent the night. Instead of
that&mdash;but that is anticipating events.</p>

<p>Presently we arrived at the guard-house, an
ordinary farmhouse the ground floor of which
had been cleared for the sterner duties of war.</p>

<p>Above the table of the N.C.O.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in charge a
large scale map hung against the wall. I was
not permitted to go near it, but its scale, being
perhaps three or four inches to the mile, allowed
me to see pretty much all there was to be
seen from the other side of the room, where I
had to spend the night on a chair. I recognized
the road I had crossed (the ditch was marked
on it); and, where the three narrow ditches
ought to have been, there began the blank space
with the name “Holland” written across it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p></div>

<p>I could not see the guard-house marked, probably
because I did not know where to look for it.
Consequently I had not the faintest idea of what
to do provided I could get away. This uncertainty
made me miss a chance. Of course I was
never alone in the room, but once during the
night the N.C.O. took me out. He had no
rifle with him; I doubt whether he had a pistol.
Naturally he kept close to me; yet, had I
only known where to turn, a break might have
been possible, without entailing unreasonable
risks.</p>

<p>At last the morning came, and with it the
usual stir and bustle. One of the soldiers
cursed me up and down for an Englishman. I
concluded he had never been to the front. We
prisoners had the same experience over and over
again: the fellows with the home billets were
the brutes and bullies. I was right, for my
antagonist was stopped short in his peroration
by a small man with a high treble voice, the result
of a brain wound.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you! You make me tired.
You’ve never seen the enemy. If any cursing
of Englanders is to be done, I’ll do it. I had
three English bullets in my body. T’other
side’s doing their duty same as we.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> “I’ve fought
against the English. As long as we say nothing,
keep your mouth shut. I’ll tell you as soon as
your views are wanted, Mr. Stay-at-home.”</p>

<p>These two latter shared their breakfast with
me, otherwise I should have had nothing. The
second one took me outside: “Sorry, old man,
hard luck! Sure you weren’t in Holland when
these &mdash;&mdash; [a nasty name] dropped on you?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Only this&mdash;strictly between you and me and
the doorpost, mind!&mdash;my friend and I would
have liked you to get home. We can imagine
what it means&mdash;‘prisoner of war.’ Make no
mistake, we’d have stopped you, if you’d come
across us. If only you’d been caught by soldiers
instead of these &mdash;&mdash; agents! Don’t let
anybody hear it, but from what I heard you were
in Holland all right.”</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock I was taken to the inn to
be examined by the “sergeant-major-lieutenant.”
On the way we passed, and I recognized,
the shed.</p>

<p>“How far is it from here to the frontier?” I
asked my escort.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>“Look here, I can’t get away from you, can I,
with no cover within two hundred yards and
you having five in the magazine and one in the
barrel? Can’t you understand that I want to
know?”</p>

<p>He eyed me doubtfully.</p>

<p>“You can spit across the frontier from here,”
he made slow answer.</p>

<p>That, I knew, was meant metaphorically, but
it sufficed for me.</p>

<p>The examination did not amount to much. I
was considered with grave suspicion by the sergeant-major,
because at that time I could not
tell him the name of the village I had escaped
from. Also, the British officer was haunting
their minds still. If he and I were not identical,
I might have met and helped him, was their
beautifully logical argument. “See that he is
taken to Bocholt on the two-thirty train and
handed over to a man from Company Headquarters.
Now take him back to the guard-room.”</p>

<p>When we got back there, they put a sentry in
the yard, who sat on a chair with a rifle across
his lap, and went to sleep. It must have been
a strictly unofficial sentry. Nobody took the
slightest notice of him, and he was quite superfluous,
because most of the soldiers off duty were
in the yard all the time enjoying the warm sunshine.
Dinner-hour came and went. I, of
course, received nothing officially, but the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
who had talked with me in the morning gave me
several of his sandwiches.</p>

<p>After dinner I was alone in the guard-room
with a fresh N.C.O. in charge, who was writing
up some reports. The window in the next room
where the men slept at night, and which was now
deserted, was not latched. I wondered whether
I could get it open and make a dash for it down
the road into the next cover. I had been fidgeting
about, and when I changed to a steady
tramp into the kitchen, through the guard-room,
and then several steps into the dormitory, it attracted
no attention. I doubt whether the N.
C. O., intent on his task, was aware of me at all.
The window was hinged, as all windows are in
Germany. Twice I visited it and got it ajar.
The third time I pulled it open, and had placed
my hands on the sill to get out, when a patrol
came into view. He saw me at the same time.
The movement of his rifle could not be misunderstood.
I closed the window and stepped
back. The patrol came into the room and gave
me some good advice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> “Don’t be a fool! We’ll
get you sure. Can’t afford not to. What do
you think would happen to us, if you escaped?
Last night, a Frenchman wouldn’t stand on
challenge. He’s dead now. This is in the daytime.”
He never reported me, though; or, if he
did, I never heard of it.</p>

<p>I talked with the soldiers now and then. It
appeared that fugitives were caught virtually
every night. They would not admit that many
got over. About one in ten was killed, so they
said; but I think that is exaggerated.</p>

<p>They laughed when I told them of the punishment
I was expecting. “You to be punished, a
civilian?&mdash;nonsense! You have a right to try
for it, if you care to take the risk. Why, military
prisoners of war get only a fortnight cell
in camp for escaping. We’ve had a Frenchman
here three times in eight weeks.”</p>

<p>Two soldiers took me to the train and to
Bocholt. There I was handed over to another
N.C.O., and after a tedious journey on a steam
tram we arrived at Company Headquarters in
Vreden, where I was again examined, this time
very thoroughly and with great cleverness.</p>

<p>That evening I was lodged in prison. Also,
the weather broke, and it was to the music of
dripping eaves and gurgling spouts that I fell
asleep.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">UNDER ESCORT</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">On the fourth morning, when it seemed to
me I had spent about a year in Vreden
prison, the warder informed me that my escort
had arrived. I had plenty of time to get over
the excitement produced by this piece of news,
for I was not called for until four o’clock, which
caused me to miss my evening bowl of skilly, a
dire calamity.</p>

<p>The soldier was waiting in the gateway.
Walking down the passage toward him, I had to
pass by a big burly N.C.O. of the German
Army, who had a tremendous sword attached to
him. I felt that something was going to happen
when I approached him. As I was squeezing
past him in the narrow corridor, he suddenly
shot out a large hand, with which he grasped
mine, limp with surprise. Giving it a hearty
shake, he wished me a pleasant <em>Auf Wiedersehen!</em>
(Au revoir!) I was almost past utterance
with astonishment, and could only repeat
his words stammeringly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> “Not on your life, if
I can help it,” I murmured when I had turned
away and was recovering from the shock. Still,
I suppose it was kindly meant.</p>

<p>My escort, a single soldier, went through the
usual formalities of loading his rifle before my
eyes and warning me to behave myself. The
cord for special marksmanship dangled from his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He was strictly noncommittal at first, and only
assured me again, apropos of nothing, during
our walk to the station, that he did not intend to
have me escape from him. Afterward he
thawed considerably, but always remained serious
and subdued, talking a good deal about his
wife and children, what a hard time they had of
it, and that he had not seen them for eighteen
months.</p>

<p>The preliminary jolt of the small engine of the
narrow-gage train gave me the sinking sensation
usually caused by the downward start of a
fast lift, and for a time my heart seemed to be
getting heavier with every revolution of the
wheels, which put a greater distance between me
and the frontier. Had I cherished hopes in
spite of all? I don’t know.</p>

<p>With several changes the journey to Berlin
lasted through the night. I was very hungry,
and the soldier shared with me what little food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
he had. Two incidents are worth mentioning.</p>

<p>At the time of my escape a political tension
between Holland and Germany had caused rumors
of a threatened break between the two
countries. The soldier who arrested me in
Vehlen had alluded to it. My escort and I were
alone in a third-class compartment of the east-express,
about midnight, when a very dapper
N.C.O. entered. He took in the situation at
a glance.</p>

<p>“Prisoner’s escort?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is he?”</p>

<p>“An Englander.”</p>

<p>“Trying to escape to Holland?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only hope the trouble with Holland
will come to a head. We’ll soon show those
damned Dutchmen what German discipline
means. We’ll sweep the country from end to
end in a week. Did he get far?”</p>

<p>“Close to the frontier.”</p>

<p>“However did he manage that in that get-up?”
and he sniffed disgustedly.</p>

<p>The other incident was interesting in case of
future attempts to escape. About an hour before
the train entered Berlin, detectives passed
along the corridors asking for passports. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
began to wonder how I had managed to get as
far as I had.</p>

<p>We arrived in Berlin about 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> Before we
proceeded to the prison, the soldier compassionately
bought me a cup of coffee and a roll at the
station buffet. I had had nothing to eat since
11:30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> the previous day, except a roll the soldier
had given me about midnight.</p>

<p>This was at Alexander Platz Station, fairly in
the center of Berlin. As we left the station,
Alexander Platz was in front of us with the façade
of the Polizei Präsidium on our right.
Turning in this direction, we entered a quiet
street along the right side of which the arches of
the railway accommodated a few small shops
and storage places underneath them. On the
other side a wing of the Polizei Präsidium
continued for a hundred yards or so. The next
building was plain, official-looking but of no
very terrible aspect, for the four rows of large
windows above the ground floor were not barred
on the outside. In its center a large gateway
was closed by a heavy wooden double door.
“Here we are,” said my escort, as he pressed
the button of the electric bell.</p>

<p>One half of the door was opened by an N.C.O.
of the army. Inside the gateway on the left a
corridor ran along the front of the building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
terminating at a door bearing the inscription
“Office,” on an enameled shield. A motion of
the hand from the N.C.O. directed us toward
it. We entered. Another N.C.O. was sitting
at a table, writing. My soldier saluted, reported,
then shook hands with me and departed.</p>

<p>“Your name, date of birth, place of birth, and
nationality?” said the N.C.O. at the table, not
unkindly.</p>

<p>I looked at the plain office furniture of the irregular
room before answering, feeling very
downhearted. Having given him the information
he wanted, I asked apprehensively: “What
are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>“We’ll put you in solitary confinement.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“You’re going to stay with us so long that
you needn’t bother yet about the ‘what then.’”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going to send me back to
Ruhleben when I’m through with my punishment
for escaping?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’ve nothing to do with it and don’t know.
But I’m pretty sure you’ll have to stay here till
the end of the war.”</p>

<p>“That’s hard punishment for an attempt to
get home!”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, you’re not going to be locked
up all the time! There are a number of
Englanders here. Most of them are up and
down these stairs the whole day.” With this
he went out and shouted for some one. Another
N.C.O. appeared. “Take this man to Block
Twenty-three and lock him up. Here’s his
slip.” The slip, I saw later, was a piece of
paper stating my name and nationality, and
marked with a cross which stood for “solitary
confinement.” It was to be fastened to the
outside of my cell door.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STADTVOGTEI AND “SOLITARY”</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">In its original meaning <em>Stadtvogtei</em> denotes
the official residence of the <em>Stadtvogt</em>.
This was an official appointed in feudal
times by the overlord of the territory, as
keeper of one of his castles, around which an
early settlement of farmers and a few artisans
had grown into a medieval town or <em>Stadt</em>.</p>

<p>Later on, as a fit successor of the old Stadtvogtei,
a prison arose in its place, which was
modernized from time to time, until in 1916 a
new modern building stood where once victims
had vanished into dungeons, and, later, political
prisoners (among them Bebel, in 1870) had languished
in dark, musty, insanitary cells.</p>

<p>Bricks, iron, concrete, and glass had been used
in the construction of this building, the scanty
furniture and the cell doors being the only wood
to be found in it.</p>

<p>I never came to know the whole of the Stadtvogtei,
but learned gradually that it enclosed a
number of courtyards. These were triangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
in shape and just sixty paces in circumference.
Around them the walls rose five stories high,
and made deep wells of them rather than yards.
The regularly spaced windows, tier upon tier,
with their iron bars increased the dreariness of
their aspect.</p>

<p>With a yard as a center, each part of the
prison surrounding it formed a structural entity,
a “block,” separated from the next one by
a space about eight feet wide, and extending
from the ground floor right up to the glass roof
above. The aggregation of blocks was enclosed
by the outer walls as the segments of an orange
are enclosed by the peel. With the cell windows
toward the yards, the doors were in the circumference
of the blocks. In front of them,
frail-looking balconies, or gangways, extending
around the blocks, took the place of corridors,
and overhung by half its width the space separating
the component parts of the prison.
Their floors consisted in most places of thick
plates of glass, fitting into the angle-irons of the
cantilevers. Iron staircases and short bridges
permitted communication between the different
floors and blocks.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself standing at the end of one
of these corridors and looking down its vista.
In the wall nearest to you the perspectively di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>minishing
quadrilaterals of eighteen evenly
spaced doors, each with its ponderous lock, bolt,
and a spy-hole in the center, with a row of ventilating
holes above them, and, underfoot and
above, the glass of two balcony floors. On the
opposite side a breast-high iron railing, beyond
it four feet of nothingness, and then the blank
stretch of a whitewashed wall, reflecting the
light from the skylights on top of the building.</p>

<p>Try to think of yourself as so situated that
a chance of “enjoying” this view mornings and
evenings, when the cell doors are unlocked for a
few minutes, is eagerly anticipated as a change
from the monotony of the cell, and you will in
one respect approach the sensations of a man in
solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Then imagine that the sight of this same
gaunt vista every day causes you a feeling of almost
physical nausea, that you keep in your cell,
or somebody else’s, as much as possible to escape
it, and you may perhaps realize a fractional
part of the circle of the disagreeable sensations
of a man who has had the “liberty of the
prison” for, say, six months.</p>

<p>As a rule such emotions are subconscious, but
they come to the surface when the periodical attack
of prison sickness of the soul lays hold of
you, a temporary affection of the mind which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
very disagreeable to the individual who suffers
from it, and may have unpleasant effects on his
companions and friends. We used to hide these
attacks as carefully as we could from one another.</p>

<p>Originally the prison had been used for criminals
undergoing light sentences of two or three
years and less, and for remand prisoners. One
entire block had been used for the latter. There
the cells were superior to those in the remainder
of the building, where there were stone floors,
very small windows, and no artificial light, while
the beds consisted of boards on an iron frame
and a paillasse. In the remand cells the floor
was covered with red linoleum, and in this part
landings and corridors were covered with the
same material, there were larger windows,
spring mattresses hinged to the wall, and&mdash;luxury
beyond belief to a man from Ruhleben
camp&mdash;electric lamps.</p>

<p>Except when special punishment was being
inflicted, the political prisoners, among whom I
count the civil prisoners of war, inhabited this
better part of the prison, comprising perhaps
three hundred cells around one yard.</p>

<p>Over a year before my arrival the German
military authorities had taken over the greater
part of the Stadtvogtei for their own prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Only a small portion was still occupied by the
civil prison authorities and their charges. One
or two of the latter occasionally appeared in our
wing, in the charge of a civil warder, to do an
odd job. They were permanently used in the
kitchen, the bath and disinfecting place, and
before the furnace.</p>

<p>In the military part of the prison N.C.O.’s of
the army acted as warders for the military and
political prisoners.</p>

<p>Of the former there were always a great
many. They were undergoing punishment for
slight breaches of discipline, or were remanded
there awaiting trial before a court martial.
Occasionally a number of French soldiers, and
now and again an English Tommy or tar, were
incarcerated among them. When this happened,
and we heard of it, we tried to help them
with food, tobacco, and cigarettes. It was very
seldom that we succeeded, as we were not allowed
on corridors the cells of which were used
for military prisoners.</p>

<p>Since, however, the remand block did not
quite suffice for the political and civilian prisoners
of war, we occasionally found ourselves in
the military block, though quartered above the
soldiers on separate corridors. In this fashion,
and on occasional trips through the prison to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
see the doctor or to get something from the kitchen,
we saw and heard enough of the treatment
meted out to the German soldiers to form an
opinion of their sufferings.</p>

<p>In this the most cherished traditions of the
German Army, and of the German N.C.O.’s,
were rigidly adhered to. We never heard one
of the poor prisoners being spoken to in an
ordinary voice by their jailers. They were
shouted at, jeered at, abused, beaten, and bullied
in every conceivable way. Their part of the
prison was in a continual uproar from the voices
of the N.C.O.’s, who evidently enjoyed the
privilege of torturing in perfect safety their fellow-beings.</p>

<p>Sometime during 1917 an N.C.O. who had
spent most of his life in England came to the
prison. I heard him talk with one of my friends
one evening. A few days after, on my way to
the kitchen, I had the unpleasant experience of
seeing him break up one of his charges. The
man had obviously had a dose before I arrived
on the scene, for he was sobbing in his pitch-dark
cell, while the N.C.O. was talking at him
in a way that made my blood boil.</p>

<p>A few weeks before this happened, a friend
of ours, a former A. S. C. man, had shot into the
cell where I was sitting with a chum. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
laughing queerly, highly excited and pale.</p>

<p>“Look into the yard, look into the yard!” he
cried, jumping on a table underneath the window.
We followed as fast as we could, but were
just too late. This is what had happened:</p>

<p>A Black Maria had been driven into the
yard. Two or three N.C.O.’s had surrounded
it and opened the door, and one of them had
climbed inside. The next moment a German
cavalryman, manacles on wrists and ankles, was
pitched literally head over heels on to the stone
pavement of the yard, where he lay, seemingly
stunned. Two of the N.C.O.’s grabbed him by
the collar and, kicking the motionless form,
dragged him through the gates, which closed
after them.</p>

<p>Most of the military prisoners were kept in
dark cells. I do not know for how long this kind
of punishment may be inflicted, but I believe six
weeks is the maximum term. Imagine what it
means to spend only two weeks in a perfectly
dark, comfortless room on bread and water,
sleeping on bare boards without blankets. Yet
that, as it appeared, would be a very ordinary
sentence.</p>

<p>This kind of punishment could be inflicted on
anybody who was directly under military law, as
we prisoners of war were. During my seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>teen
months in prison, it occurred only once that
an Englishman, an ex-navy man, got a week of
it. My particular friends and I were able to
get a well-cooked, hot meal to him on most days.
When he came out, he vowed he could have
stuck a month of it, thanks to our ministrations,
but his drawn face seemed to belie his words.</p>

<p>While the military prisoners had their food
sent in from a barracks outside&mdash;judging from
what we saw of it, it was rather good&mdash;we were
supplied from the prison kitchen. The food
varied somewhat in quality and quantity at different
times. In 1914 and again in the following
year it was nauseous, and so insufficient
that after four weeks in prison young men found
it impossible to mount the four flights of stairs
to the top corridor in less than half an hour.
When I arrived it happened to be comparatively
good for a few weeks. The amount one got
would have kept a man alive, though in constant
hunger tortures, for perhaps six months, if he
was in good condition to start with.</p>

<p>Breakfast was at 7:30 and consisted of a pint
of hot black fluid, distantly resembling very thin
coffee in taste, and a piece of bread weighing
eight ounces, black, but much better than the
bread we were accustomed to in camp. A pint
of soup was served for dinner, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
never any meat in it. Rumor had it that meat
was occasionally added but disappeared afterward.
The staple substance in the beginning
was potatoes, with mangel-wurzels during the
following winter. By far the best soup, which
disappeared from the bill of fare altogether for a
long time, contained plenty of haricot-beans.
It was usually given out on Saturdays or Sundays,
and tasted rather good. Another one, tolerable
for a hungry man, consisted of a sort of
black bean, with hard shells but mealy kernels,
and potatoes. A fish soup appeared on the
menu three times a week; fortunately one could
smell it as soon as the big pails left the kitchen
at the other end of the building. This gave one
a chance of accumulating the necessary courage
to face it in one’s bowl. It really was horrible
beyond words.</p>

<p>At about five o’clock a pint of hot water with
barley was intended to furnish the last meal of
the day. Often there was less than a pint of
fluid, and most often the barley was entirely absent.
But the water had always a dirty blue
color; consequently it did not even appeal to
one’s æsthetic sense. On Sundays these rations
were sometimes supplemented by a pickled
herring or a small piece of sausage. I could
never bring myself to touch these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsistence on the prison food exclusively
would have been almost impossible. I am not
speaking from the point of view of the average
man, who has had plenty all his life, but as a
one-time prisoner of war in Germany, who has
seen what incredibly little will keep the flame of
life burning, at least feebly.</p>

<p>Fortunately, almost all the politicals or prisoners
of war obtained extra sustenance in some
way or another, although the majority of the
Poles and Russians did so only occasionally and
in small quantities.</p>

<p>As far as the British were concerned, we got
enough food from England in our parcels to
do entirely without the prison diet. Those
amongst us who found themselves temporarily
short of eatables simply drew from others who
were better supplied.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had had a foretaste of prison in Cologne in
November, 1914, which had not been encouraging.
Consequently I felt apprehensive enough,
while mounting the stairs behind the N.C.O. on
the morning of my arrival.</p>

<p>The prison being very full, only a convict cell
ten feet long and five wide was available for me,
into which I was thrust without ceremony. A
small window, barred, and high up in the nar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>row
wall, faced the door. The bed on the left
was hinged to the brick work and folded flat
against it. A stool in the corner by the door
was balanced on the other side by the hot-water
pipes for heating. Farther along, toward the
window, a small double shelf, with three pegs
underneath, took the place of wardrobe, cupboard,
and bookcase. It held a Prayer Book, a
New Testament, an earthenware plate, bowl
and mug, a wooden salt-cellar, a tumbler, and
a knife, fork, and spoon. Against one side of it
hung a small printed volume of prison rules and
a piece of cardboard, showing a dissected drawing
of the shelves, with the contents in regulation
order, and an inventory underneath. In
the center of the wall a small table was hinged
and fastened like the bed. A Bible text above
decorated the cell.</p>

<p>When in the course of the morning bed-linen
and a towel were issued to me, I was vastly
pleased. I had not expected such luxuries.
The former consisted of a coarse gray bedcloth,
an enormous bag of the same material, but
checkered in blue, and another small one of the
same kind. The big bag was to serve as a cover
for the two blankets, which were to be folded
inside; the small one was a pillow-slip.</p>

<p>Dinner meant another welcome interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
in the difficult task of settling down, and, since
it was Saturday, turned out to be bean soup.
Although the quantity was far short of what I
required, particularly in my famished state, it
appeared so tasty, so far beyond anything I had
been accustomed to in camp as far as German
rations were concerned, that I was beginning to
think myself in clover.</p>

<p>Still, I was in solitary confinement. How
long was this state of affairs to last? I had
asked the man in charge of the canteen, a British
prisoner who paid me a visit in his official capacity.
He did not know. He had had four
and a half months after his escape of the previous
summer. The N.C.O.’s refused to commit
themselves, if they answered my questions
at all. So I tried to face the prospect of being
shut up in a small cell, with no company but my
own, for five months. On this basis I worked
out the final date, made a very rough calendar,
and thereafter at 11 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, the hour of my arrival
in the Stadtvogtei, marked with great ceremony
the termination of every twenty-four hours in
“solitary.”</p>

<p>I was not examined again, contrary to my expectations,
and my clever plans, framed in Vreden
prison, of “diddling the Boche” into a forgiving
frame of mind could not be tested. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
hopes of a glimpse of Ruhleben camp and my
friends were not realized. The term of my solitary
confinement evidently was regarded as a
state secret, not to be communicated even to
the person whom it most concerned. This was
a policy always pursued by the <em>Kommandantur</em>
in Berlin&mdash;whether out of sheer malice
or callous indifference I don’t know. Since I
was the first escaper to be punished under
a new regulation, there was no precedent to form
an opinion from; but I did not know that, and
consequently expected the same term of “solitary”
as other men before me. Those who came
after me were not permitted to have much doubt
about the subject. We saw to that.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day I was told
that, in addition to solitary confinement, punishment
diet had been ordered by the powers that
were. One day out of every three (for four
weeks) I was to receive bread and water only.
It sounded unpleasant. The canteen man, who
came to see me every day for a few minutes,
assured me that this was something new, quite
outside his experience, and, being pressed,
cheered me vastly by consenting to my expressed
opinion that it might, perhaps, indicate a correspondingly
short term of “solitary.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, the punishment diet proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the reverse of what it was intended to be, an aggravation.
In filling power, twenty-four ounces
of bread were far superior to the ordinary
prison food, and much more palatable than fish
soup. Very soon I began to look forward to
my “hard” days.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day a different
N.C.O. took charge of my corridor and me. I
cannot speak too highly of him. Good-natured
and disinterestedly kind, he made my lot as easy
as possible. Knowing a little about prison
routine by now, I had got up before the clanging
of the prison bell had sounded, apprehensive of
being late. Then I set to work cleaning my cell,
scrubbing the floor and dusting the “furniture,”
and was quite ready when the doors were opened
to permit us to empty the cell utensils and get
fresh water. This was soon accomplished, and
I lingered outside in the corridor to enjoy the
“view.” Not far from me a Polish prisoner
was cleaning the balcony floor, and the N.C.O.&mdash;let
us call him Kindman&mdash;was trying hard to
make the Pole understand that the water he was
using was too dirty for the purpose. The poor
Pole, not comprehending a word, was working
away doggedly, while Kindman was gradually
raising his voice to a shriek in his efforts to
make his charge understand, without producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the slightest effect. He was not at all nasty
about it, as one would have expected from a
German N.C.O.; he merely substituted vocal
effort for his lack of knowledge of Polish.</p>

<p>“I tell you, you are to use clean water, not
dirty water, clean water, not dirty water, dirty
water no good, no good,” shaking his head.
Pause, to get a fresh breath. Roaring: “Clean
water, clean, clean, clean!” Despairingly he
glanced in my direction. I fetched my own pail,
full of clean water, put it beside the Pole’s, and,
stirring it with my hand, nodded vigorously.
Then, pointing to the thick fluid in the other pail,
I made the sign of negation. The Pole understood.</p>

<p>“You cleaned your cell before opening time
this morning?” Kindman asked a little later.
“You needn’t do that. I’ll get you a <em>Kalfacter</em>&mdash;a
man to do the dirty work for you.
You’re a prisoner of war. You are allowed
these privileges. There are plenty of Poles
here who’ll be only too glad to do it for a mark a
week.”</p>

<p>After some hesitation I assented. In camp I
had perhaps taken a foolish pride in doing
everything myself, with the exception of washing
my underclothes. Now, in prison, I had a
Kalfacter to scrub and clean. Instead, I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to do my own washing, not liking to entrust
it to the doubtfully clean hands of a Pole.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you a better cell,” was Kindman’s
next announcement. A few days after I moved
into one of the remand cells with its comfortable
bed, its nice red “lino” floor, and a bright electric
light burning up to nine o’clock, while hitherto
I had sat in darkness of an evening.</p>

<p>So far so good. There were no terrible physical
hardships to endure. It was unpleasant
not to have enough food. I did get some help
from my fellow-countrymen, but parcels were
arriving irregularly just then, and it was little
they could spare me. My own had stopped altogether,
and I had only very little money to
buy things with, and that borrowed, and consequently
it had to be hoarded like a miser’s until
I could get some of my own. I was always hungry,
and often could not sleep for griping pains,
while pictures of meals I had once eaten, and
menus I would order as soon as I got to England,
kept appearing before me.</p>

<p>It was a red-letter day when my hand-bag
arrived from the sanatorium. Besides the
clothes, it contained several tins of food, which I
determined to consume as sparingly as possible.
That, however, was easier planned than done.
Knowing the food to be within reach, I simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
could not keep my hands from it. It all went in
two days. I remember getting up in the middle
of the night to open a tin containing a Christmas
pudding, and eating it cold to the last crumb.
Marvelous to relate, I went peacefully to sleep
after that.</p>

<p>The actual treatment in “solitary” was much
better than I had hoped for in my most optimistic
moments. Mentally, however, I suffered
somewhat during the first fortnight or three
weeks. I had to battle against the worst attack
of melancholia I had ever experienced. I
never lost my grip of myself entirely, but came
very near succumbing to absolute despair. The
uncertainty about the duration of my punishment,
the cessation of all letters and parcels
from Blighty at a time when I most wanted
them, the fear that my correspondence would
merely wander into the waste-paper basket of a
German censor, and last, but not least, the lack
of response from my friends in camp to my
post-cards&mdash;all combined to depress my spirits
horribly.</p>

<p>I began to wish heartily that I had made a
daylight attempt from the guard-house, which
certainly would have ended my troubles one way
or another. The drop from the balcony to the
stone flags below had an unholy fascination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
For a number of days I gazed down every moment
of the few minutes I was allowed outside
my cell.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the war I had read of the
attempted escape of a British officer from a
fortress in Silesia. When he was apprehended
somewhere in Saxony, he committed suicide with
his razor. “What a fool!” had run my unsympathetic
comment to my friends; “what did
he want to do that for?” Now I could not forget
his tragic end, and not only understood his
action but almost admired him for it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every afternoon the other men in solitary
confinement and I spent an hour&mdash;from three to
four o’clock&mdash;walking in single file round the
yard. An N.C.O., with a big gun strapped to
his waist, kept guard over us, and had been ordered
to see that we did not talk together. With
an indulgent man on guard it was occasionally
possible to get in a word or two, even to carry
on a conversation for ten minutes or so. In
this way I made the acquaintance of all the other
Englishmen who were in the same position as I.</p>

<p>As I became more cheerful, I began to relish
the books which were sent to me by the other
English prisoners, and to look about for means
of snatching what enjoyment I could under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
circumstances. Two visits to the prison doctor
for the treatment of “sleeplessness” gave me
opportunities of chatting for half an hour with
my friend Ellison, who faked up some complaint
on the same days.</p>

<p>My punishment diet was to end on the 8th of
May. That over, I expected another four
months under lock and key, until the 10th of
September.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, while tramping round the
yard, the sergeant-major, second in command,
came in and beckoned me to him.</p>

<p>“You’ve finished your ‘solitary’!” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say to-day?” I asked.
“Am I to have my cell door open, and may I see
the other men?”</p>

<p>When the hour of exercise was over, I sped up
the stairs, taking four steps at a stride, and
searched for Kindman.</p>

<p>“I’m out of ‘solitary,’” I bawled. “I’m
going to see the other chaps!”</p>

<p>“Hey, wait a moment,” he cried. “I must
lock your cell door first.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>“But I tell you I’m out of ‘solitary’!”</p>

<p>“I believe you, though I don’t know officially.
I’m not going to lock you in, but lock the door
I will. If we leave it open, you’ll find all your
things gone when you come back. These Poles
would take anything they can lay their hands
on, and small blame to them. Most of them
haven’t a shirt to their back.”</p>

<p>I did not return to my cell until lock-up time,
feeling comfortably replete from various teas I
had had, and my throat raw from incessant talking.</p>

<p>The part of our block reserved for men in solitary
confinement, one side of the triangle, was
separated from the rest by iron gates on each
landing. These gates barred access to the military
part as well. They were always kept
locked. To clamber over them was easy
enough; to be seen doing so spelled seven days’
cells. My first care, consequently, was to get a
cell “in front of the gate.” This term was
equivalent among us for ordinary confinement
as opposed to solitary, for, in ordinary circumstances,
nobody would willingly stay in a
cell “behind the gate” if not in “solitary,” and
was, in fact, not supposed to do so.</p>

<p>An unexpected physical phenomenon, which I
afterward observed in others, made itself unpleasantly
felt in my case. The first days following
my release from “behind the gate” I was
extremely nervous and restless; at times I
longed to be back in “solitary” with the cell
door securely locked upon me.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CLASSES AND MASSES IN THE STADTVOGTEI</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The prisoners interned in the Stadtvogtei
were divided into two classes, the aristocrats,
or rather the plutocrats, and the rest, thus
repeating faithfully the state of affairs in the
outer world.</p>

<p>To the former belonged all the British without
exception, a few occasional Frenchmen and
Belgians, a number of Russians of education and
means, temporarily some German socialists&mdash;they
would be disgusted if they read this&mdash;and
one or two German undesirables, adventurers
and high-class pickpockets, who had come out of
prison recently, but were probably not considered
safe enough to be at large.</p>

<p>The “rest” was composed of an ever-changing
mass of Russian and Polish laborers, never
less than two hundred and fifty in number.</p>

<p>Wealth admitted to the upper class. The
possibility of procuring food was wealth. This
explains why all the British were plutocrats, for
they received parcels from home, and had more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
food, as a rule, than anybody else. Frenchmen
and Belgians, on the contrary, held a precarious
position on the outside edge of society. Not
having friends in Germany who could supply
them with food, as was the case with the Russian
and German plutocrats, and their parcels from
France and Belgium being exceedingly few, they
were frequently in straits. But then, of course,
they were “taken up” by some of the “plutocratic”
Englishmen, who chose their associates
according to other standards than those of digestible
possessions.</p>

<p>As far as malice aforethought is concerned,
Englishmen have been, and are, the worst
treated of all the prisoners of war in Germany.
I believe the Russians had a harder time of it
from sheer neglect by the higher authorities, being
delivered over to the tender mercies of the
German N.C.O. and private soldier, clothed
with a little brief authority. This class of human
beings was always chary of tackling Englishmen,
either singly or in small groups.</p>

<p>In the Stadtvogtei the usual order was reversed.
There we were the cocks of the walk
among the prisoners, and, in time, entirely unofficial
privileges developed appertaining to us
as Englishmen. They were inconspicuous
enough in themselves. An incident will serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
as an illustration. It was the more startling in
its significance as I had no idea that the privilege
in question had come to exist until it had
happened.</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1917. The prisoners
in ordinary confinement were allowed to be in
the courtyard at certain hours of the day, but
were supposed to enter and leave it only at the
full and half-hours. I had observed this rule so
far, except on a very few occasions, when I had
asked the doorkeeper to let me in and out at odd
times. I was doing certain work for the British
colony, which now and then called me there on
business.</p>

<p>One morning I happened to be walking about
with Captain T., then recently released from
solitary confinement for an attempt at escaping.
We were waiting for the door to be unlocked to
leave the yard, and when the doorkeeper opened
it between times, I, followed by the captain,
passed through, nodding my acknowledgment to
the N.C.O. On seeing my companion, he
stepped up to him threateningly and shouted,
“What d’you mean by coming out, you &mdash;&mdash;”
I had not grasped the situation, but jumped between
them instinctively and said, “Hold on.
This is an Englishman!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, I didn’t know. I
thought he was a Pole. I’ve never seen him
before.”</p>

<p>Captain T. had missed the meaning of the affair,
and I had to explain it to him. I went up
the stairs to our cell feeling very chesty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Up to the beginning of June, 1916, the British
numbered less than twenty. During the course
of the summer and autumn our colony grew until
we were about thirty-four strong. More than
half of the new arrivals were escapers. We had
our experiences in common, and a class feeling,
even some class characteristics. We certainly
all felt equally hostile to that particular section
in Ruhleben camp whose attitude toward us was
summed up in these words: “Aren’t you
ashamed of yourselves? Can’t you stay and
take your gruel?” We were actually asked
these questions.</p>

<p>K. was the doyen of our group. He was older
than the rest. His attempt, with a companion,
in April, 1915, to which I have referred in a previous
chapter, was the first made from Ruhleben,
and he had been at liberty longer than any
one else&mdash;more than three weeks. He was one
of the most charming men one could wish to
meet, though, as he was a Scotsman, it took some
little time to break down his reserve. Hailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
from the same part of the kingdom, there were
W. and M. who had been in prison since June,
1915, followed soon after by Wallace Ellison, my
friend and comrade-to-be, and another man&mdash;both
excellent fellows. Wallace was my neighbor
on the right, as K. was on the left, when I
had succeeded in getting a cell on the top floor,
coveted on account of the light and air and the
greater expanse of sky visible from the window.
Of some of the men who came after me I shall
speak later on.</p>

<p>One of my companions, not an escaper, was
Dr. Béland, a well-known Canadian. He had
been residing in Belgium when the war broke
out, and, although a physician, he had been
arrested in the summer of 1915, and sent to
prison in Berlin. The Germans regarded him
as a member of an enemy government, and
justified their action in their own way, by saying
that this eliminated his standing as a
member of the medical profession. As a matter
of fact, Dr. Béland was not a member of the
Cabinet in Canada, and had not been for some
time. He belonged, however, to the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>Dr. Béland was a man of great personal
charm. His wide experience, his high good
humor, which never failed under the ordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
trying conditions of life in prison, his readiness
to help all those in distress, and his brilliant
powers as a conversationalist, made it a delight
to meet him. In the course of time we got to
know each other well, and in January, 1917, he
rendered us, particularly a friend and myself, a
great service by the delicate handling of an affair
which almost got us sent to a penal prison.</p>

<p>Little consideration was ordinarily shown him
by the German authorities. When they had an
opportunity, as once happened to be the case,
they treated him with a refined cruelty which
created universal indignation among his companions.</p>

<p>Apart from the British who were permanent
boarders at our establishment, occasional birds
of passage on their way to Ruhleben camp
alighted there for a night or two. Most of them
were boys who had been residing in Belgium.
Unable to get away when the invasion overwhelmed
that unhappy country, and not having
attained the “internable” age of seventeen,
they had been compelled to stay on, until the day
of their seventeenth birthday brought their arrest
and subsequent internment as a Greek gift
from the conquerors.</p>

<p>Among the other plutocrats, whatever their
nationality, we found some cheery and inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>esting
companions. Several of the socialists
were men of high intellectual attainments and
charming manners. We were on the best terms
with them, a circumstance which, I believe, gave
rise to some uneasiness to the prison governor.
He certainly had always something nasty to say
about them, looking down from the height of
his semi-education upon men who knew what
they were talking about, who knew&mdash;none better&mdash;the
German governing classes, and who were
perfectly frank about them. We often had
them to tea in our cell. They gave us sufficient
insight into the pre-war intrigues which led to
the catastrophe, and into the falsehoods and
falsifications of the German Government, to
make us catch our breath.</p>

<p>The component parts of the “rest,” the Polish
and Russian laborers, came and went. We did
not get into real contact with them. The difficulties
of language stood in the way, for one
thing. Poor and ignorant, most of them illiterate,
they were greatly to be pitied. With very
little besides the prison food to live on, and
constantly maltreated by the N.C.O.’s, it is still
somewhat of a marvel to me that they did not
succumb. Their powers of passive resistance,
their ability under such circumstances to keep
on living, and even to retain a certain amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of cheerfulness, can be explained only by their
low intellectual and emotional standard and the
centuries of slavery or semi-slavery their ancestors
had endured.</p>

<p>The most pitiable objects were boys, children
almost, who occasionally appeared among them.
Tiny mites they were as to stature, with the
faces of old men on bodies of children of eight
or nine years of age. They, too, had been recruited
by German agents. Most of them
seemed to have been sent into the coal-mines,
where hard work and little food had broken
them completely. Their actual years were usually
between thirteen and sixteen.</p>

<p>With their mental powers almost destroyed,
and nearly too weak to walk, they used to sit in
their cells or stand listlessly about the corridors,
their eyes lusterless and vacant.</p>

<p>Whenever any of them were about, they were
taken on by some of us as pensioners. But even
a hearty meal set before them did not bring a
smile to their lips or a gleam into their eyes.
Like graven images they wolfed it down, tried
to kiss your hand or the hem of your coat, and
went to sit or stand as before.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">PRISON LIFE AND OFFICIALS</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Not long before I arrived in prison, a change
had taken place in its official personnel.
Formerly, the internment side and the military
side had been under different commanders.</p>

<p>What I heard from my friends about the character
of the man in charge of the interned, previous
to my coming, caused me to congratulate
myself upon my good luck in not having to encounter
him. He had been an out-and-out bully.
He was transferred to Ruhleben camp later on,
where he went under the name of “Stadtvogtei
Billy.”</p>

<p>The officer in command of the prison after
“Stadtvogtei Billy” had gone, had charge of the
interned and military prisoners. This <em>Oberleutnant</em>,
to give him his German title, was a
schoolmaster in civil life. As such he was a
government official and duly imbued with the
prescribed attitude of mind.</p>

<p>Officially we had not much to do with him.
Occasionally we had to approach him for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
small request or other, and found him courteous
enough then. When he took the initiative,
something disagreeable usually happened, or
was going to happen.</p>

<p>Often he called upon some of us for a chat.
That was always something of a trial. He
never could get rid of his <em>ex cathedra</em> manners;
he knew only the approved official version of
whatever he was talking about, and mostly chose
rather unfortunate themes for his discourses.
“Prussian superiority in everything, but particularly
in war,” “the eminent qualities of the
Prussian rulers,” “Prussian strategy in war
favorably compared with that of other nations,
particularly the British,” “Jewish treason and
wickedness”&mdash;such were his favorite topics.
Quite frankly he ran down everything British
and American. The United States in particular
was sighing under the absolute rule of two
wicked autocrats, one called the “President,”
the other the “Almighty Dollar.” They were
inhabited partly by Germans and partly by a
mass of ignorant and unteachable fools and
cowards, who, unable to grasp the intellectual
and moral righteousness of the German nation,
spouted against them, but were afraid to act.
He used to bore us to tears, and his departure
was always followed by sighs of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Of middle size, he was well built, and kept
himself superbly fit. He knew a little about
boxing, and often commanded one of the Englishmen
to be his sparring partner in one of the
big empty cells of the military part. His tactics
were to strike blows as hard as he could.
Once or twice this was discouraged by his opponent.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major came officially into contact
with us every day when he made his rounds.
He was a handsome fellow, stout, with almost
white hair and a fresh complexion, much
younger than he looked, and an old army man.
With the mannerism of a German N.C.O., he
was a kindly fellow at heart, and easy to get on
with. Although his voice could be heard thundering
somewhere in the prison at any hour of
the day, his bark was ever so much worse than
his bite.</p>

<p>The N.C.O.’s acting as warders in our section
were always considerate to us and the other
plutocrats, though in different degrees and for
different reasons. One or two treated us decently,
quite spontaneously, and strictly within
the limits of their duty. As for the rest, a <em>quid
pro quo</em> was the more or less openly confessed
basis of their behavior toward us.</p>

<p>The scarcity of food in Germany made it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>expensive
and easy for us to keep the wheels
oiled. A tin of herring or of dripping, or a few
biscuits went a very long way. I think we were
perfectly justified in making these small donations.</p>

<p>The doctor visited the prison only for an hour
or two every morning, except Sundays. Any
one who was foolish enough to be taken suddenly
and seriously ill after he had gone, had to wait
until the next day, and, if he carried his stupidity
so far as to do it on a Saturday, he could
not hope for medical attention until Monday
morning.</p>

<p>Dr. Béland always helped as far as he could in
such cases. Many a night he was fetched out
of bed to give first aid. He was handicapped in
this work of charity by his lack of drugs and
stimulants.</p>

<p>There was a chapel in the prison, whose parson
was supposed to look after our spiritual
welfare. Personally, I never spoke to him, nor
did I approach his shop. The expression fits, as
I shall try to demonstrate.</p>

<p>Among us we had an engineer, M., who felt it
necessary to observe his religious duties, and
wished to take part in the services held in the
chapel. He went to the parson to proffer his
request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Lord God is not for the English,” were
the words in which he refused it.</p>

<p>The unchanging routine of our prison day was
as follows: the doors of the cells, locked during
the night, were opened again at half-past seven
o’clock in the morning. While the Kalfacters
cleaned the cells, we prepared breakfast in the
kitchen. The meal over, some went into the
courtyard for a walk, while others employed
themselves in whatever way they felt most
inclined. The canteen was open from ten
o’clock until half-past ten. At eleven o’clock
the midday soup was distributed. It did not
concern us Englishmen, for we never took our
share. The kitchen was opened again now for
the preparation of the midday meal, and there
was usually a rush to secure one or more of the
gas-rings. The cleaning of vegetables, peeling
of potatoes, and other preparations had been
previously undertaken in the cells by all hands.
The cooking itself was attended to by the cook
of the mess and day. Soon after eleven the
distribution of parcels from England was to be
expected. On their arrival an N.C.O. went
into the yard and shouted the names of the
lucky ones, generally mispronouncing them.
Leaving everything to take care of itself, their
owners went helter-skelter down to the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to take possession of their packages. From
half-past three o’clock till five it was again
possible to brew tea and cook, and from
four to six to be in the yard. At seven o’clock
we were locked up for the night. In summer,
artificial light was not permitted in the cells;
in winter, the current was switched off at nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>The most important question for us was that
of the food-supply. If, accidentally, a week or
two was barren of parcels, the man who missed
them was apt to become a nuisance to his companions
by his constant expressions of grieved
astonishment about this “absolutely inexplicable
stoppage.” This was the case regardless
of whether he had a month’s supply in hand or
not.</p>

<p>It did not mean that we were gluttons. Apart
from the absolute necessity of receiving a sufficient
amount of English food, parcels and letters
were the links connecting us with the Old
Country. When a link was broken we felt lost
and forsaken. A cessation of letters had a similar
effect. Our correspondence was limited to
four post-cards and two letters a month. Communication
between prisoners of war in different
places of internment was prohibited. We
were not informed of this, however, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
summer of 1917. A great light dawned on me
then, for I could understand at last why my
friends in camp had not written to me.</p>

<p>While in “solitary” and for two months
afterward, I had a struggle to make both ends
meet as far as food was concerned. Only a
modicum of my letters and parcels from England
arrived. I was absolutely ignorant of the
fact that friends were helping me with a generosity
for which I can never be sufficiently
grateful. Having no relatives who could send
me food, I applied at last to one of the organizations
sending parcels to prisoners of war and
was adopted by a generous lady in Southampton.</p>

<p>About that time I joined a mess of four. The
pooling of our resources made them rather more
than merely sufficient for us. I debated whether
I should stop the last-named parcels. But there
was always so much opportunity of helping
others, and so much doubt whether our parcels
would continue, that I said nothing.</p>

<p>Among a section of the British community it
had always been considered an obvious duty to
help their less fortunate compatriots with food,
when they could afford it and the latter were
in need. All new-comers required help until
their parcels began arriving. Those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
placed in solitary confinement had to be looked
after during the term of their punishment, for
they were not permitted to have their parcels.</p>

<p>At first this was all done without method and
with resulting hardships to individuals. When
coöperation among the greater number of the
British prisoners was finally brought about,
every man “behind the gate” received tea for
breakfast, a hot dinner of canned meat and vegetables,
and a substantial supper at five o’clock.</p>

<p>Occasionally we received cases of food from
the Relief in Kind Committee at Ruhleben to be
distributed among the British. Here again little
method was observed at first. But in course
of time the organization was perfected.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of May, 1916, the prisoners
had to heat their food on spirit stoves as best
they might. Then fuel for these stoves became
unobtainable, and the prison authorities turned
one of the large cells on the top floor into a
kitchen, installing a number of gas-rings at the
private expense of the British colony. For a
charge the equivalent of a cent, one could obtain
a pint of boiling water or use one of the
rings for half an hour.</p>

<p>As long as vegetables were obtainable, we
fared very well. On our declaring that we could
not take the prison food, the authorities issued
potatoes to us by way of compensation. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the winter of 1916-17 the scarcity of this vegetable
became so great in the “Fatherland” that
mangel-wurzels were generally used instead, of
which we got our scanty share. It was a severe
tax upon our culinary skill to disguise them
sufficiently to make them eatable. Palatable
they could not be made. I was cook at the time
for a small mess and the sauces I manufactured
with the help of curry-powder, pepper, salt, vinegar,
and mustard, would haunt a professional
cook to the end of his days.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have dwelt a long time upon this
question of food. But then, it was the most important
one for us. We never could escape it.
Three times a day at least we were reminded of
it by the necessity of preparing a meal. Our attitude
toward food and eating was largely influenced
by a feeling of insecurity. “How long
will it be before our parcels stop arriving?” was
a question ever present in our minds.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that we seldom lost our
appetites, despite the fact that we could take
little exercise. Officially, the only place to get
this was the yard. Paved with granite blocks,
it did not offer altogether ideal facilities. The
sun reached the bottom of this well in one corner
only during the three best months of the year.
In fine, mild weather it was always so packed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
with humanity&mdash;and that not of the cleanest
kind&mdash;that the air was worse than in the cells.
Except in rainy or cold weather it stagnated,
and engendered a feeling of lassitude which
often was the precursor of a headache.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the prison was badly ventilated,
although seemingly ample provision had
been made for a change of air in the building.
At certain hours of the day smells of the worst
kind pervaded the corridors. In the broken
light of the evening, the pall of fetid and evil air
surrounding the whole place became visible
to any one looking from an upper window
across the yard toward the bright western sky.
In spite of all, however, Swedish drill at night,
occasional fierce romps with our friends, or a
few rounds with the gloves in a space which
permitted only a stand-up ding-dong way of
sparring, kept us in tolerable health.</p>

<p>We were fortunate in having a considerable
number of private books. In addition to these,
the Ruhleben camp library sent us consignments
which we returned for others. From serious
and instructive books to the lightest kind of
literature, we were plentifully supplied with
reading matter.</p>

<p>Sometimes we managed to get hold of an
English newspaper. They were on sale in Ber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>lin
but strictly forbidden to us prisoners. The
reason for this prohibition has always been to
me one of the inexplicable vagaries of the German
mind. The “Daily Telegraph” and the
“Daily Mail” were read on the sly, mostly after
lock-up time, by one after the other, until they
fell to pieces.</p>

<p>The royal game of chess was a great consolation.
It was played to excess, often resulting
in staleness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first two escapers to arrive after me were
C. and L., a happy combination of Scotland and
Ulster. They had gotten away from camp in a
very adventurous fashion, to be caught three
days later by an unfortunate combination of love
and flowers.</p>

<p>At dawn, one morning, they had found excellent
cover in a clump of lilac bushes growing
close to an unfrequented road. In the course of
the morning a German soldier, fully armed, was
passing their hiding-place, when he caught sight
of the lilacs in bloom. Some flaxen-haired
maiden must have been in his thoughts, for he
started to gather a bunch of them. Only the
best flowers would do, of course, but they were
inside the thicket, away from the chance passerby.
With his eyes lifted in search of the blooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the soldier did not see the two fugitives until he
trod on them. Before they had time to do anything,
he had them covered with his rifle.</p>

<p>When C. and L. came out of “solitary,” they
and Wallace and I soon became good friends.
Naturally, we discussed the chances of another
attempt to escape from prison. If possible, we
would make that attempt together. For this
purpose it would be desirable to be in one cell.</p>

<p>There were four big cells on each landing at
the three corners of the courtyard. They were
by far the most desirable, with good company to
share them with you. They had a water-tap
and a private lavatory, and their cubic capacity
per man was considerably greater than that of
the single cells. When one of these on the
fourth floor became temporarily empty at the
beginning of July, the four of us asked for and
obtained permission to take it.</p>

<p>We all felt a little doubtful about the experiment
at first, but it turned out magnificently;
and for all purposes we were a very strong
combination.</p>

<p>As far as I was concerned, the happiest time
of the whole of my three years as a prisoner of
war was spent in that cell. I slept well again,
and I lost the restless feeling which had obsessed
me while in a cell by myself, for I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
gone through a time of great spiritual loneliness
before C. and L. arrived. Now I simply basked
and expanded in this circle of congenial companionship.
I seldom cared to leave the cell,
and almost ceased visiting my other friends in
theirs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Generally speaking, the internment in the
Stadtvogtei was no worse than the internment in
Ruhleben camp. The latter was healthier, and
there were ever so many more distractions, with
opportunities for sport and serious work. The
camp could be almost pleasant in summer, but it
was terrible in wet or cold weather. The prison
was always the same, neither hot nor cold.
Climatic conditions, the changes of the seasons,
did not affect us at all. Ruhleben was one of the
dirtiest places in the world; Stadtvogtei was always
clean and dry.</p>

<p>We worked hard, nevertheless, to bring about
our return to Ruhleben. Whether any of us
preferred the life in camp or that in prison, on
one point we were all agreed: the camp was
much easier to escape from.</p>

<p>So we sent periodical petitions to the Kommandantur
in Berlin for transfer to Ruhleben,
and on the rare occasions when a representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
from the American Embassy or, later on, from
the Dutch Legation, paid us an unexpected visit
we never failed to complain bitterly about the
injustice of being kept in prison. But these
complaints did not avail. It was probably due
to the comparative charm of the life in a big cell
that no actual attempt was made by us four between
June and October, 1916. Discussions of
ways and means were frequent, of course, in
secret meetings throughout the house. For a
long time the plans under consideration always
involved the destruction of iron bars in front of
our windows and the erection of a light scaffolding
made from table boards and legs. This scaffolding
was to help us gain the roof, and less
perilously than the method favored by our
friend Wallace. But Wallace was a crag-climber
in civil life. We understood perfectly
that his hobby had affected his brain and would
not allow him to climb to any high point unless
he could, by stealth or cunning, do it in the most
dangerous way. Under pressure, however, he
was still sane enough to relinquish his idea&mdash;for
this once. We applied the pressure. Once on
the flat roof of our portion of the prison we
were to traverse it for some distance, and
then drop down the face of a blank wall, sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
feet high, by means of a rope we had plaited
from strings saved from our parcels. I doubt
whether the rope was quite long enough.</p>

<p>We finally hit upon another plan. Its attractions
were very tempting in comparison
with the first one, and we tried to put it into
execution.</p>

<p>If we could get out of our cell at night and
open a window on the first floor, we could easily
drop into the street. As I have mentioned in
an earlier chapter, the windows of the prison
overlooking the street were not barred on the
outside except on the ground floor. These were
made impassable by iron gratings on the inside
which opened like a door, and were unlocked
by the same key that fitted the locks of
our cell doors. The windows themselves were
opened by a hollow square key. A pair of small
strong pliers would do as well.</p>

<p>The corridors were almost incessantly patrolled
at night. The necessity of trying to
dodge the patrol would be not only disturbing
but somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>Next the stairs, on each landing, was a room
used for various purposes. These rooms were
not patrolled. The one on the first floor which
was naturally the most attractive to us was
labeled “CLERK.” This too had the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
lock as the cell doors. In there we should be
quite undisturbed while attending strictly to
duty.</p>

<p>We made a key out of a piece of thick wire
and the tin lid of a priceless beer-glass. The lid
was beautifully and appropriately engraved.
So was the glass, which had a considerable sentimental
value. Wallace, the rightful owner, sacrificed
the lid on the altar of the common weal.
With the wire as a core we cast the key in a
plaster-of-Paris mold and filed it to fit. C. filed
it. He would not let anybody else touch it.
He now holds it as his most treasured souvenir
of the war.</p>

<p>It was not at all difficult to obtain the plaster
of Paris for the mold. The making of the key
was an extremely simple affair altogether,
though it sounds extremely romantic.</p>

<p>The opening of the cell door was an outside
job, for the lock was quite inaccessible from the
inside with any of the instruments we possessed.
One of us had to get himself locked out by mistake,
hide somewhere in the prison, and release
the others at the proper time. Wallace volunteered
to do this. He got the job.</p>

<p>On the top floor of the building, in a sort of
blind corner, was the prison library. It was
separated from the rest of the corridor by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wood-and-glass partition. Above its door was
an opening large enough to offer an easy passage
for Wallace’s small but athletic frame.
As the library would hardly be used after lock-up,
Wallace would be more than reasonably safe
there during his vigil.</p>

<p>We intended to walk from Berlin to the Baltic
Sea and make the passage to the nearest Danish
island in any kind of craft we could dishonestly
come by.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“All there?” asked the N.C.O. in charge of
our corridor at seven o’clock of the evening
fixed for the new venture.</p>

<p>C. and I were sitting opposite each other at
chess. L. was bending with knitted brows over
another chess board. The stool opposite him
was empty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered absently, without lifting
my eyes from the board.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ellison?” using Wallace’s surname.</p>

<p>I looked up and made a motion toward the
privy our cell boasted.</p>

<p>“All right. <em>Gute Nacht.</em>”</p>

<p>“Good night, Herr Unterofficier!”</p>

<p>The door swung closed and the bolt shot home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
L. continued playing chess with himself, still
with that concentrated look of his. C. was mean
enough to take an unfair advantage of my inattention
and declared “mate” after ten or
twelve more moves.</p>

<p>Then we talked disjointedly with long pauses
after each remark. “Wace must have managed
all right.” “Seems so.” “Too early to
do anything yet.” “Oh, I don’t know. If they
come in here again to-night, the game will be up
anyway.” “Not necessarily; we might have
luck.” “We certainly need it for the next ten
days or so.” “Oh,” with the long yawn of
nervousness, “let’s eat.” “All right, let’s
eat.” We ate. Then we started dressing.
Double sets of underwear in my case, and also
collar and tie. I had almost finished, though my
two friends still looked pretty much as usual,
when we heard footsteps approach our door and
the rattle of the key in the lock. With a white
stiff collar around my neck, albeit without coat
or waistcoat, I took a flying leap toward the
door and into such a position that the whole of
my person except my face would be concealed by
one of our two-storied bed structures. It was
our N.C.O. who appeared through the opening
door. Without coming farther than half a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
into the cell he handed me, who was nearest to
him, a bundle of letters from “Blighty” and
disappeared again.</p>

<p>We completed our preparations and then lay
down on our bunks in order to get as much sleep
as possible while there was a chance. We did
not get much during the next five hours. We
were under the nervous stress of having to wait
for somebody else to act. The hours seemed to
be of Jupiterian size. Occasionally one of us
would turn over and mutter something, mostly
commenting upon the situation we were in, expressing
his views briefly and forcibly. Now
and then I lost consciousness in brief spells of
slumber. I think our emotions were not very
different from those experienced by men who
are waiting for the zero hour to go over the top.
As my brief fighting experience was in the artillery,
I cannot speak with authority.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, with a tremendous noise and
without warning, a key turned in the lock and
Wallace came into the room in his stocking-feet,
carefully fastening the door on the inside by a
little wooden latch. The latch was a strictly
unofficial attachment of our own making.</p>

<p>We were up and around him before he had
done with the door. “No use. We’re up
against it,” he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>We were not absolutely unprepared for this.
We had been alarmed at something during the
afternoon of that day. I forget now precisely
what it was. It had been somewhat intangible.
Yet it had puzzled us a good deal. As Wallace
had needed some assistance in getting into
the library, we had been forced to take one or
two of our comrades into the secret. We felt,
of course, as sure of their trustworthiness as we
were of our own, but it is always possible to
make a mistake.</p>

<p>“I’m certain they have a suspicion that something
is afoot,” Wallace explained, “and are
merely lying low in order to catch us in the act.
They may not know who it is. When I came
out of the library I passed X.’s cell. The door
was a quarter open. There was a light inside
and they were talking. That pig Doran [one of
the N.C.O.’s] was in there. I then sneaked
down to the clerk’s room in order to open the
door. I couldn’t. Has none of you noticed
that there is a countersunk screw through the
bolt? Has any one of you ever seen that door
used? Now, what are we to do?”</p>

<p>We decided not to go that night. We were
unanimous. Briefly, Wallace told us the rest of
his adventures while we crept between our
blankets. I personally felt of a sudden very,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
very tired. But before I fell asleep I reasoned
with mixed feelings that we might have pushed
the attempt a little further.</p>

<p>We were up at an unusually early hour in
order to remove all traces of our fell intent.
We unpacked the two small grips we had wanted
to take with us and put our extra clothes away.
The cell, to appear as usual, required general
tidying up.</p>

<p>Hoch, our N.C.O., thrust a startled face in
upon us when he came to unlock the door at
seven o’clock. As usual, L., wrapped in
blankets up to his chin and over his ears, was
placidly puffing clouds of smoke toward the ceiling.
As usual, C. and I were performing our
morning ablutions in front of the sink. As
usual, Wallace was watching us sleepily from
his elevated bunk next the door, waiting for his
turn, and hoping that it might be long in coming.</p>

<p>Hoch, after his first swift survey while still
in the corridor, had quickly advanced to the center
of the room and looked immensely relieved
when he had counted his chickens.</p>

<p>“Why, your door was unlocked!” he exclaimed.
Wallace nodded sleepily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, one of your fellows came in and disturbed
us at six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. We were asleep and he woke
us up. Very rude of him. He just looked in
and walked away, and forgot to lock the door.”</p>

<p>Hoch laughed loud and long, like a man who
has had a bad jolt and finds himself unhurt.
He was an Alsatian and as such was always
more or less suspected of disloyalty. In order
to shield him as much as possible we had chosen
a night when he would not be on duty, but even
so, he would have found himself in difficulties
had we got away.</p>

<p>Friend Hoch was a smart man, however.
Nothing further was said about the open door,
but he didn’t believe us; of that I’m certain.
Nothing had happened, so he let sleeping dogs
lie, but he made up his mind that nothing should
happen. He was uncomfortably vigilant from
then on. He never locked up, after that, until
he had made sure that we were all in our cell.</p>

<span class="smaller">A FRESH ATTEMPT</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The failure of our attempt had a stimulating
effect upon us. Wallace, always
ready to do anything at any time and under any
circumstances, the more romantic and adventurous
the better, nosed around on his own
hook. C. and L. said little, but would have
required no persuasion to do things which a
person like me would have called foolhardy. I,
myself, had been only too well aware of the
many flaws in our previous plan to take its failure
to heart. The biggest of these flaws was
our intended procedure after we had broken
prison. In the absence of a good opening I
cogitated mainly upon the best way of action,
once the start lay behind us. I will
give here some of my reflections, because they
shed light upon our subsequent proceedings.</p>

<p>To escape from the prison, a small amount of
help from outside was more than desirable.
To break out was not impossible; to do so
carrying the necessary food and equipment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
meant minimizing our chances very considerably,
and they were slender indeed, at the best.
Once outside, what were we to do? Was it
possible to walk through the streets of Berlin
at night carrying bundles and hand-bags? It
must be remembered that crime was rife in Germany,
and the police as inquisitive as monkeys.
Could one go to a hotel and wait there for an
early train on which to get away? To walk
out of the capital appeared impossible, for we
had heard that a considerable number of military
police, with power to stop anybody, were
always about, looking for deserters and watching
the roads to the country. None of us knew
a friendly soul in Germany of whom we could
ask assistance, nor had we a knowledge of the
capital and its seamy side, which would have enabled
us to disappear in the under-world of
criminals and to purchase assistance there.</p>

<p>In August, two Englishmen, who had escaped
from Ruhleben and who had managed to live
in different towns of Germany for several
weeks, had joined our band of prisoners.
They had had false passports, an absolute
knowledge of the German language, and had
been caught only through their own carelessness.
Both were awaiting trial on a charge of
traveling with false papers, and on one other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
count. G., a tall, distinguished-looking man
with a drawling voice and stately manners, had
nothing to lose and everything to gain by another
attempt. C. was approaching his forty-fifth
birthday, and hoped for an exchange.</p>

<p>In September, S., another man from Ruhleben,
had turned up. He said he was an escaper, but
I had my doubts. I don’t think he was British,
even technically speaking, although the Germans
considered him so. He was daring and
clever, however, and had friends in Berlin, and
there was no doubting his sincerity when he
swore that he would not stay in the Stadtvogtei
at the pleasure of the Germans, even if an attempt
to escape cost him his life.</p>

<p>G. and S. chummed up with each other. A
German with an English name, of doubtful
calling in civil life but of powerful physique,
joined them. Toward the end of October, Wallace
found out definitely that something was
afoot, S. being the leading spirit.</p>

<p>Without conceit I believe I can say that my
friends and I were regarded by all who knew
us as “dead safe.” Nothing on earth, not excepting
faithlessness on the part of those we
trusted, or had to trust, would have made us
squeal. We must naturally have appeared an
easy prey for any unscrupulous man, since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
would have nothing to fear. Private vengeance
would have been far too costly for us.</p>

<p>This being so, Wallace’s questions received
ready answers. S. was about to obtain a key
for the main gate of the prison. A blank was
being filed right then by one of his friends outside,
to an approximate fit, according to a rough
drawing he (S.) had made after a chance inspection
of the key in the hands of the gatekeeper.
When the rough key was delivered he
would have to file it to a working fit. This
done he and his party would wait for an opportune
moment on a dark evening and walk out
of the prison by the front door.</p>

<p>The scheme was an excellent one, as far as it
went, and S. had no objections to our joining
his party. On the contrary, he seemed to my
liking far too pleased. Why should he receive
us with open arms, when it was patent that the
danger of discovery increased with numbers?
Without promising definitely to join his party
we agreed to help him in fitting his key and getting
away. Almost three weeks went by before
everything was ready, and this brought us into
the middle of November.</p>

<p>This was another serious drawback. For a
long tramp the weather was decidedly too cold.
We could not hope to be able to take along even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
an inadequate equipment. Under these circumstances
the hardships would be such as to make
sleeping in the open for a week, or a fortnight,
impossible. The use of the railway would
be imperative, which was against C. and L.’s
chances. Neither of them spoke a word of German,
and both were so striking in appearance
as to make their arrest almost a foregone conclusion.
C. was about six feet tall, broad out of
proportion, and the picture of well-nourished
health; while L., with black hair, black bushy
eyebrows on overhanging bone ridges, a mustache
the like of which had never been seen in
Germany, and a typical seaman’s roll, could
have passed about as well for a full-blooded
Chinaman as for a son of the “Fatherland.”
A word from Wallace or me would make
them withdraw, but that word we could not easily
bring ourselves to speak.</p>

<p>Wallace, on the other hand, did his utmost to
convince me that we must not let this opportunity
slip by. The other conspirators would
certainly go, and their escape would close this
one avenue forever.</p>

<p>“If you stay behind, I’ll go with the others.”
Another quandary. He would not get through,
I felt sure, for he proposed to throw in his lot
with S., looking to him for help, which he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
get only as long as it suited S. and no longer.
As we had no maps, and Wallace on his first
escape had walked only a few miles, and those
with a guide, our only chance lay in striking my
old route. On this second trip we might cover
the distance in two nights, which meant spending
only one day in hiding. My knowledge of
the disposition of sentries along that stretch
of frontier might possibly get us across, even
under adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>I had never felt so uncomfortable in my life
as I felt when I had to explain to C. and L., that
it appeared impossible to take them along with
us, and my feeling of utter shamefacedness was
only intensified by their immediate and good-humored
withdrawal.</p>

<p>To take anything with us beyond what we
could put in our pockets was not to be thought
of. Could we send out a parcel or two and
have them deposited at a station cloak-room?
Neither Wallace nor I could. We had never
sent parcels from the prison. S.? Yes. He
was eternally sending them away. He proffered
his services, which were accepted. A parcel
was handed over to him to be deposited at
a certain station, the cloak-room ticket to be
handed to us. When the ticket came&mdash;there
was only one&mdash;he showed it to me, but ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>plained
that he could not give it up, as some of
his own luggage was booked on it. He would
go with us for our parcel, or get it for us in
another way. We were to meet him in Berlin
anyhow, for we had accepted his offer to procure
us quarters where we could stay a day
or two in safety. His further assistance, which
was to make our “getting through” a moral
certainty, I had declined both for Wallace and
myself.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of November I
said I would not go. At four o’clock I said
I would, and meant it. Between five and six
we went.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was already dark at this time. On the
ground floor and next to the stairs was the office
of the prison. From its door one had an unobstructed
view of the whole length of the corridor
and of that part of the gateway connecting
the street with the yard, nearest to the front
gate. Fortunately the door was always kept
shut at this time of the year on account of the
cold.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper had his office in one of the
cells off the corridor. He could not see the
gateway without leaving the cell. The gateway
was at right angles with the corridor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
not very well lighted. Two steps led down to
its level. In passing from the corridor into the
yard the front door was to the immediate right
of the steps.</p>

<p>At this period of our imprisonment the prisoners
had access to the yard at any moment
during recreation time. It was cleared for the
day at half-past six o’clock. Wallace and I
went there at the appointed time&mdash;five o’clock&mdash;wearing
our overcoats, as usual, but our best
clothes underneath. The others were already
there.</p>

<p>A sixth man had been admitted to the party,
a German stockbroker. This upset Wallace so
much that the slightest attempt at persuasion
on my part would have made him give up the
venture altogether. But now that I had made
up my mind I rather urged him on.</p>

<p>That morning an N.C.O. had come on duty
at the gate who some months before had insisted
upon being armed while on duty, and
who had declared his intention of preventing
any one from leaving the building alive, if an
attempt should be made. Since he was bound
to discover the open gate almost at once, we
had a fair chance of getting hurt, which greatly
perturbed G.</p>

<p>At length the moment of action came. S., fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>lowed
by the rest of the conspirators, made as
if to return to his cell. Once inside, he went
straight to the front gate, while the powerful
German put his back against the gate we had
just passed through, to prevent anybody from
following us. Wallace and I walked up the
steps into the corridor and stood there, chatting,
to screen S. while he unlocked the door.
He failed in his first attempt. The second time
he was successful.</p>

<p>We slipped through the door and found ourselves
in the deserted street in front of the
prison. The others, contrary to agreement,
broke into a run and disappeared around a corner
on the left. Wallace and I walked leisurely
until we turned underneath a railroad bridge
to the right.</p>

<p>We felt somewhat relieved when we had
turned the corner. During the walk up the
street we had expected every moment to hear
the crackle of automatics beginning behind us.
It is one thing to face a gun; it is another to
expect to be shot in the back.</p>

<p>We were to meet S. and G. at a certain café
close to the railway station where our parcel had
been deposited, but it took us a long time to
get there, as we did not know our way about
Berlin, and were unable to hire a taxi or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
droshky. They had almost given up hope when
we arrived.</p>

<p>We sat down at their table in a well-lighted,
large room. Everybody seemed at ease except
me. I felt nervous, but tried to hide it. During
the next half-hour S. left us several times
to telephone, as he said, to the house where
Wallace and I were to stay. Each time he
came back saying he could not get the connection.</p>

<p>“Let us go and get our luggage, then,” I
suggested.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say you wanted to buy some
things?” S. queried.</p>

<p>“Yes; we want to see whether we can get a
couple of oilsilks, two water-bottles, a portmanteau,
and, if possible, a couple of sleeping-bags.”</p>

<p>“You’d better hurry up, then. The shops
will be open only for another hour. We’ll meet
you at Café &mdash;&mdash; at ten o’clock. In the meantime
I’ll arrange for your lodgings.”</p>

<p>I was doubtful, but we had trusted him so
far; it seemed foolish and impolitic to show
suspicion now. Moreover, to have to carry the
parcel would be a nuisance if not a danger. So
we agreed and left them.</p>

<p>In a big department-store we bought the arti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>cles
mentioned. The sleeping-bags were thin,
by no means waterproof and almost useless, but
better than nothing. Clothed as we were, in
ordinary town clothes only, I was much concerned
to get what extra protection from the
cold we could.</p>

<p>While I was completing this purchase, a
shop-walker addressed me and followed up his
introductory remarks with a reference to the
latest air raid on London and a pious wish as to
the fate of the d&mdash;&mdash;d English. I heartily endorsed
his sentiments, while Wallace, with dancing
eyes, grinned facetiously at me. Just at
closing time we left the store and took the hand-bag
to the station cloak-room.</p>

<p>Walking about the streets to wile away the
time until ten o’clock, we met S. and G. carrying
their luggage. “Hullo, what the &mdash;&mdash;!
It’s all right, boys; be at the place at ten.”</p>

<p>We were there at half-past nine. We were
still there at eleven. Nobody came. Several
times I made the round of the café, even though
we sat close to the only entrance and could not
miss them if they came. At half-past eleven
we left, but returned in twenty minutes. Then
we gave up hope.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM BERLIN TO HALTERN</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The night was bitterly cold. The extraordinarily
mild weather of the last weeks
had changed at the most inopportune moment.
A few hard flakes of snow were now and again
driven into our faces by a searching wind.
We were without shelter, without food for the
walking part of our enterprise, without adequate
clothes. In Wallace’s case a year and a
half, in mine seven months, of prison life had
not improved the condition of our health. We
were decidedly too soft to stand a number of
days of cold weather without at least some fatty
nourishment.</p>

<p>I pictured us sleeping in ordinary townish
winter clothes on a freezing day, perhaps with
snow on the ground, in thin sleeping-bags consisting
of an outer cover of canvas and a light
lining of shoddy. We should be wet through in
half an hour. The moisture would freeze on
our garments as the generation of body heat,
already at a low ebb for want of food, decreased.
Then, we would go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>I imagined us trying to slip through between
two sentries, five hundred yards apart, with patrols
in between, and over bare fields, while the
snow-light gave tolerable vision up to a mile.</p>

<p>I was so disheartened that I proposed that we
should walk to the prison and give ourselves up.
We could plead that we had gone away for a
lark. Our punishment would almost certainly
be light. There had been precedents which warranted
this view. It was not impossible that
the German authorities might come to the conclusion
that one escape apiece had been enough
for us. In this way we might get another
chance under more favorable circumstances.
If we persisted now, we had not one in ten thousand,
and we firmly believed that after capture
we should be sent to a penitentiary prison and
guarded beyond hope of another attempt.</p>

<p>With splendid pluck and determination Wallace
talked me round. No, he was not going
to do anything of the sort. Let them catch him,
if they could, but no voluntary surrender for
him. I could do as I liked, but we might find it
easier than we thought.</p>

<p>“All right! Let’s go to a hotel!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t safe. We must try to get somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>I intended to have my way now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> “No fear!
From what S. told us, it is safe enough. We
both speak German pretty well. If we leave
the place before eight o’clock we’ll be all right.
Look at C. and G.! They never had to show
their passports at the hotels. This way to the
station for our luggage! Say, do you know a
small hotel hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is the &mdash;&mdash;. I stopped there
once. But it is a good long way from here.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try it, anyway.”</p>

<p>I had pocketed the luggage-ticket. At the
station I could not find it. An agitated search
through my pockets failed to reveal the square
thin paper. We were standing in front of the
cloak-room, and I was still hunting through my
pockets when a man approached us.</p>

<p>I had caught sight of him out of the corner
of my eye while he was still some yards away.
If ever there was a detective in plain clothes, he
was one. Deliberately I half turned my back
toward him. He stepped up close to my shoulder
and peered over it, listening to what we
were saying. I dared not take any notice.
Wallace’s eyes, boring for a moment into mine
while he lolled against a counter, are still clear
before me.</p>

<p>A few months earlier I had received an answer
to one of our petitions, in a fine official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
envelop with a huge blue seal on the back.
With an indefinite idea that the seal might be
used as an effective camouflage, I had kept the
envelop by me. I drew out my pocket-book,
and while searching through it, held the back of
the envelop conveniently exposed to the eyes
of the detective.</p>

<p>“I must have left it at the hotel. Let’s go
there and send for the luggage,” I said aloud
in German. The detective turned away. So
did we.</p>

<p>A single cab stood in front of the station. I
turned toward the station police-office to get
the brass disk, but was met half-way by the
policeman, who had been watching us. He
handed it to me without a word.</p>

<p>The hotel at which we wished to stay was full.
After some palaver cabby took us to one near
by, where we got a room. It was a very small
place. The night-porter seemed to be the only
servant on duty. He appeared somewhat suspicious,
but said nothing about it.</p>

<p>The double-bedded room we were shown into
looked very nice. We thought it ridiculously
luxurious, but Wallace went to bed at once. It
was about one o’clock. While undressing I
found the luggage-ticket in an inner waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>I had still about two hours’ work ahead of
me, for I had to map out the route for the
following day. I was quite convinced that Berlin
was too hot for us. We had not yet discussed
our further plans, but had bought a
time-table at the station.</p>

<p>Finally, having considered a number of alternative
routes, I selected a slow train, which
was to leave the Zoölogical Garden Station,
where our luggage was, at 10:24 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> for
Hanover, and was due to arrive some time
after 6 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> I went to sleep, dead tired, at
about 2:45.</p>

<p>We got our knock and hot water at 6:30, as
ordered. Having dressed, we went into the
breakfast-room. A nice, comfortable-looking
body presided there; I believe she was the proprietress.
We had foreseen the formality of
the visitors’ book, and had our names and addresses
pat. The landlady peered at them, then
at us. I had to negotiate with her for our
breakfast, for we had no bread-cards and wanted
something to eat.</p>

<p>“You are foreigners, aren’t you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, no! Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“I thought so from your accent.”</p>

<p>“We’re not from this part of Germany, as
you can see by the visitors’ book.” I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to add that we had lived a long time abroad,
etc., but, if I recollect rightly, I did not. I
don’t believe it safe to volunteer information,
unless one is telling the truth.</p>

<p>“That’s quite all right, then. We have to be
so careful about strangers! Just sign these
emergency slips for your bread-cards. Thank
you, sir.”</p>

<p>During a very sketchy breakfast consisting
of coffee, rolls, and butter, a young lieutenant
passed down the room, and with a bright smile
saluted us civilly. Wallace and I looked at
each other, grinning covertly. What a lark!
If he knew!</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight we left the hotel and
slowly made our way toward the station. Having
plenty of time, we entered a café to have a
chat and another breakfast, even more sketchy
than the first. We were the only guests in the
place, and had to wait for the milk. Here I
outlined my plans for the day. At last Wallace
assented.</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” I said, rising. “Let’s
see what we can buy in the way of food. Chocolate
first.”</p>

<p>In a high-class confectioner’s we were told
that chocolate was out of the question, but
<em>chocolates</em> we could have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>“What price?”</p>

<p>“Nine marks [$1.75] a pound!”</p>

<p>We could not afford more than two pounds,
because the things we had bought the night before
had made a big hole in our joint capital
of $125.00&mdash;in German money, of course. Next
we obtained two small tins of sardines at $1.10
each. Our efforts to buy something in the way
of meat or fat were not crowned with success.</p>

<p>At the station, however, things went well, in
spite of my extreme agitation when buying the
tickets.</p>

<p>Within the first half-hour we passed Ruhleben
camp, and had a glimpse of the grand
stands, the barracks, and the enclosure, which
we knew so intimately from the inside.</p>

<p>At about 12:30 the train stopped for over an
hour at Stendal. The station restaurant supplied
us with a fairly ample fish meal, beer, and
coffee. Another long stop occurred later on.</p>

<p>During the journey we passed a considerable
number of prisoners’ camps. They seemed as a
rule to be situated close to a railway line, within
easy distance from a small station. The aspect
of the huddled hutments, the wire fences around
them with watch-towers at the corners, and the
sentries on guard, was indescribably forlorn.
At one station at which we stopped a transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of Russian prisoners entrained under a guard
of ancient territorials.</p>

<p>Wallace was in high spirits all the time. I
was, on the contrary, moody, irritable, and worried.
My feelings were in complete accord with
the weather.</p>

<p>A lowering gray wrack of clouds was being
torn and driven by a whistling wind above the
naked fields and copses. Occasionally showers
of hard snowflakes could be heard rattling on
the glass of the carriage windows. Our compartment
was over-heated, as trains always are
in Germany. Yet, I shivered occasionally, as I
looked out of the window, while trying to construct
a small optimistic raft to cling to in a
sea of despondency. I made a bad companion
that journey.</p>

<p>Hanover was reached on time, and the luggage
temporarily disposed of in the cloak-room.
The town greeted us with a brief but thick blizzard&mdash;about
the worst thing that could happen
to us short of arrest. Confronted with it, my
spirits improved.</p>

<p>“Snow, or no snow, we’ll make the best attempt
we can at the frontier,” I whispered.</p>

<p>“Just what I think,” Wallace agreed heartily.</p>

<p>His boots did not fit him well, and I urged him
to buy bigger ones. A suitable pair, shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
us in a shop, cost $15.00, too much for our declining
purse. When Wallace looked up at me
from his chair, mutely shaking his head, I could
not insist on the expenditure.</p>

<p>After that we walked about the streets, looking
for a likely hotel. We decided on a dirty
fifth-rate one, to which we resolved to return
later, and then wandered back to the brighter,
fashionable part of the town. We had dinner
in a big restaurant. The warmth, the lights,
the show of gaiety around us, and an ample but
meatless meal accompanied by a glass or two of
decent lager, made me feel subduedly optimistic.
Wallace was nearly jumping out of his skin with
<em>joie de vivre</em>.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock we went to our hotel. It was
unnecessarily low-class. We did not seem to fit
into the scheme of things there, and consequently
were regarded with half-concealed suspicion.
Nevertheless, no questions were asked.
Our room was cheerless and cold. We waited
until our luggage was brought; then Wallace
crept into bed, while I sat in my overcoat near
the guttering candle, looking up trains.</p>

<p>I intended to get to Haltern the following evening.
The main railway lines lay across our
route, and several changes were necessary, there
being no direct trains over the branch lines we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
had to use. My task proved a difficult one.
Few trains were running in Germany at that
time. The fast corridor expresses, which we
could have taken over comparatively small
stretches, had to be carefully avoided, for we
knew now of the existence of passport controls
on them. The slow trains did not usually connect.
After much comparing, testing, and retesting,
I was fairly satisfied at last.</p>

<p>I had resolved not to leave Hanover from the
main station. Detectives might be watching for
us there. By using electric trams we could get
to Hainholz, a village near Hanover, and there
pick up our train. At about 12:30 we should be
at Minden. A two-hours’ wait there, and a
journey of about one and a half hours would
take us to Osnabruck by about 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> Forty
minutes later a non-corridor express would
carry us to Haltern, where we should arrive
at 7:30.</p>

<p>I was nearly beat when I tumbled into bed at
two o’clock, envying Wallace, whose regular
breathing had filled the room for hours past.</p>

<p>Bang, bang, bang! bang, bang, bang!</p>

<p>“All ri&mdash;” I began.</p>

<p>“<em>Danke schön, danke!</em> [Thank you],”
shrieked Wallace, to drown my voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>I opened my eyes foolishly, to a dark room.
A match spluttered, the wick caught, and Wallace’s
eyes glittered reproachfully into mine
from behind his glasses. “I say, do you know
what you said?” This in German.</p>

<p>“Well, I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shshsh, you chump, <em>Deutsch!</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“We’d like breakfast, please!” This to a
youth in the bar-room.</p>

<p>“Have you got your bread-cards?”</p>

<p>“No. We’re travelers; we’ll sign travelers’
slips.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. You can have a cup of
coffee.”</p>

<p>“Look here, we got bread at a restaurant last
night without them. Why can’t you give us
some?”</p>

<p>At this suggestion the uncivil youth lost his
temper completely, and we were fain to content
ourselves with a cup of German coffee-substitute.</p>

<p>Before eight o’clock we were out of the place.
Our luggage was again in the cloak-room of
the main station. A long walk got rid of most
of the time before us. At ten we tried to buy
some nuts. The oil they contained would sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ply
our bodies with fuel; but none were to be
had.</p>

<p>Having got our luggage, we took a tram to
Hainholz, where we arrived far too early. The
cloak-room and ticket-office of the small station
were closed. Some minutes after eleven the
train left. It was a pleasant change to get into
the hot carriage after the cold station.</p>

<p>At 12:30 we arrived at Minden. The huge
dark waiting-room seemed full of intangible
menaces. We spent an exceedingly uncomfortable
time there, but were recompensed by an excellent
meal. A considerable piece of veal, with
plenty of vegetables, blunted our fears and appeased
our ravenous hunger.</p>

<p>At the station where next we had to change
we found our train waiting on a siding, and at
7:30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> we arrived in Haltern.</p>

<p>The weather had been much the same as on
the preceding day, a little colder, a little more
snow. With the prospect of getting within
walking-distance of Holland, my spirits were
not so depressed. It is such a bonny feeling to
get on “your own feet,” instead of having to
wait in a railway carriage or station, expecting
to feel a hand on your shoulder, and hear a voice
asking you for your papers!</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">WESTWARD HO!</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Until we got out into the open country I
was to walk in front, carrying the portmanteau,
which was a little too bulky a load for
a man of smaller stature than mine. Wallace
was to follow twenty or thirty paces in the rear,
but not to lose sight of me.</p>

<p>Into the town and the market-place it was
plain sailing. Without looking at the sign “To
Wesel,” the existence of which I had forgotten,
I turned into the right lane, recognizing it from
its general aspect. Nevertheless, the darkness
made the ground which I had traversed in
daylight look different.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads a long procession of street
lamps disappeared down the street which ought
to have been the right one. On my first escape
I had failed to notice these standards on what
then looked like a country road. They are not
very conspicuous in daylight. I had had my
eyes fixed upon the landscape generally, rather
than upon details close to me, which had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
meaning for me at that time. Furthermore, I
had very soon taken a path on the left.</p>

<p>For the moment I was confused, and, not being
able to take bearings in the dark, I walked
ahead, up a lane, pondering the situation. Here
were no lights, which was inviting. A woman
passed me, and a moment after Wallace closed
up rapidly.</p>

<p>“Did you see that woman?” he asked. “She
turned and looked after you. She’ll inform the
police. We’ve got to get off the road!”</p>

<p>“All right! It’s dark enough for anything.
There is no danger. Just let’s get off the road
and see whether anything happens.”</p>

<p>We waited some time, but nothing occurred.
Nothing could, as a matter of fact, for we didn’t
wait long enough.</p>

<p>“I can’t recognize this road,” I complained.
“The darkness makes everything look different.
We’re too far east. That road with the lamps
along it is the right one, after all.”</p>

<p>“You’re absolutely wrong,” came the quite
unexpected opposition from Wallace. “We’re
too far west.”</p>

<p>I had only been soliloquizing aloud, to give
Wallace a chance of understanding every step
we took.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>“How can you know that?”</p>

<p>“I saw a sign, farther back, ‘To Wesel.’
That means we are too far west.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you saw the sign, and did we
pass along the road in its direction?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain!”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it at all. We simply
can’t be too far west!” Wallace had seen the
sign in the market-place. This being the starting-point,
his conclusion was not warranted.
But he could not know that. I, on the other
hand, was sufficiently doubtful on account of the
lamp standards, and Wallace’s opposition
turned the scales.</p>

<p>“All right,” I conceded ungraciously, for I
am rather touchy about my woodcraft, “if
you’re so sure of it, we’ll walk straight north.
In that way we’ll come across the road we are
looking for, if you’re right. If not, we can
turn back. Now we’ll find a place to pack our
knapsacks and get rid of this beastly bag.”</p>

<p>We left the road definitely now, close to a
church which stood dark and lonely among open
fields. We were still near Haltern, but the
night increased the distances.</p>

<p>A drop of rain struck my face. Delighted, I
turned to Wallace, who was behind me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> “I
say, I believe it’s coming on to rain. It would
be fine if the weather got mild again!”</p>

<p>Behind a wall, which enclosed a churchyard,
we stopped to get ready for the road. We
packed our knapsacks as best we could in complete
darkness, for our only flash-lamp refused
to act. While we were doing so, it really began
to rain, and we slipped into our oilsilks. Then
we started out across-country, due north, walking
by compass.</p>

<p>The going was terrible. The ground was
frozen hard and the rain on coming in contact
with it congealed to ice, which caused us to slip
and stumble on the unyielding ridges between
the furrows, and now and again to come down
hard. The exertion kept us warm. When I
took off my hat for a moment, to wipe my forehead,
I found the brim full of solid ice.</p>

<p>We proceeded for about half an hour, up-hill
all the time. Then the edge of a wood stopped
us. That decided me: I knew now that we were
following the wrong course.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>“Look here, Wace, there’s not a shadow of a
doubt in my mind that we are too far east.
Haltern is bearing south. If we were anywhere
near the right road, it ought to lie in a southeasterly
direction. If we had been too far
west, we should have come to the woods much
sooner. We can make one very decisive test.
We’ll go east, until the eastern extremity of
Haltern bears south. Then we shall know that
we are too far to the east!”</p>

<p>We altered our course accordingly and proceeded
in this new direction. Suddenly the
ground disappeared from underneath my feet,
and I fell headlong down the banks of a deep,
hollow road. Wallace was saved by being last.
Up the other side and across more fields we
came to another road. Here we almost ran into
a man, whom our sudden appearance frightened
out of his wits, to judge by the way he hurried
off toward the town.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Haltern bears almost southwest
now. Back we go to the cross-roads. Southeast
will take us there in a straight line. Come
along.”</p>

<p>On the way back I noticed for the first time a
change in my companion. His steps, all of a
sudden, seemed to have lost their elasticity,
while I grew stronger and more contented every
minute.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is. I know it from the way
you walk!”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel extra well. Something wrong
with my stomach. It’ll pass soon, I expect.”</p>

<p>That was bad news. We came to a lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
wooden hut, like a very small barn. I stopped.
“Tell me frankly if you think you can’t go on.
In that case we’ll break in here. We’ll have
a certain amount of shelter inside. There is no
danger. To-morrow will be Sunday and nobody
is likely to come near us. It is much better to
stop in time, before you have drawn too much
upon your reserve strength. The situation is
not precarious enough for that. You’ll want
that later on.”</p>

<p>“No,” he insisted; “I can go on.”</p>

<p>At last we turned into the road we were looking
for. The rain had changed to sleet. The
road was slippery with ice. Progress would
have been slow under any circumstances, but
it was slower on account of Wallace’s failing
strength. He was plucky, however, and he kept
going.</p>

<p>The usual thirst began to trouble us. Fortunately
we had filled our water-bottles at the
hotel in Hanover. To husband our supply on
Wallace’s behalf, I contented myself with sucking
the ice which I peeled in lumps from my hat
brim.</p>

<p>In due course we came to the first clearing.
The outlines of a barn on the right, and a house
on the left, seemed familiar. “Let’s rest a
bit,” I proposed to Wallace, for he seemed al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>most
done. He propped himself in a sitting
posture against the wall of the barn, while I
scouted around.</p>

<p>There was a farmyard behind the structure.
The barn itself consisted of a loft, reared on
strong uprights. Only half the space below was
enclosed by boards, and filled with compressed
straw. The other half was open, and contained
a big farm wagon. Between its wheels and the
straw a number of clumsy ladders were tightly
wedged. In the gable of the loft an open door
showed a black interior.</p>

<p>“There will be straw up there,” I said to
Wallace. “The cattle were given a fresh bed
to-day, probably. Nobody will want to fetch
straw on a Sunday. We’ll be quite safe.”
And I went through the same argument as before.</p>

<p>Wallace was undecided for a moment, I believe.
But, to tell the truth, I had spoken rather
too sharply to him a little time before. My
only excuse is that I was exceedingly worried.
Rotten as he felt, he was bound to be nettled.
“No,” he said; “I will go on.”</p>

<p>It was obvious that he was suffering from
an attack of something akin to indigestion. I
was unable, though, to make head or tail of his
attack. When I pressed him for information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
he told me he had swallowed some shaving-soap,
mistaking it in the dark for chocolate. He had
hardly any pain, but our pace decreased gradually
to a crawl as we neared the crest of the
spur of hills, where the path which I had used
on my first escape branched off. Not having a
torch, I missed it, but discovered my mistake
about two hundred yards beyond. We had
come out of the forest. Plowed fields on our
right had given me the first hint of my error.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to turn back. I’ve missed the
path,” I informed my friend.</p>

<p>“I can’t move any farther. I must lie
down,” answered Wallace indistinctly, swaying
on his feet.</p>

<p>Too miserable to say anything, I led him
back, and some way into the timber got out his
flimsy sleeping-bag, and put him inside. Then
I felt his pulse. It was going at the rate of
about one hundred and thirty a minute.</p>

<p>“How do you feel?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Done for, old man. But don’t you worry.
You go on. No use spoiling your chance. You
leave me here. I’ll be all right.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’m not going to leave you, except for a few
minutes. I want to find that path. I’ll be
back in a quarter of an hour. You’ll be all
right that long, won’t you?”</p>

<p>I was still hoping for a miraculous recovery,
although Wallace’s rapid pulse had upset me
sorely. My mind was tenaciously holding to the
idea of “carrying on,” and I wished to know
how to get my companion on the right road
without wasting his precious strength.</p>

<p>It took me less than ten minutes to find the
path. The groping about in the darkness of the
wood had taken my mind off the real issue.
Now, on my way back, I had to face the ugly
situation we were in.</p>

<p>I had not enough medical knowledge to gage
the insignificance of the accelerated heart action,
and thus almost feared the worst. If only
he could be sick! Perhaps he was going to die
on my hands! If he lived through the night,
could I hope that his strength would return to
him on the morrow and allow us to proceed?</p>

<p>One thing was out of the question: I could
not leave him alone, even if he was out of danger
and in shelter, for we were both fully persuaded
that, in the event of capture, we should
be sent to a penal prison. But what was to be
done? Wallace could not lie out in the cold
the rest of the night and all the next day. The
only shelter reasonably near was the barn,
which we had passed some time before. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
should have to go back to it. We had to reach
it, even if I had to carry him.</p>

<p>The snow, which had come on again, was
whispering in the trees when I entered among
them, groping in the thick darkness for his recumbent
form. It sifted straight down through
the still air, while the wind shrieked and roared
overhead. He called feebly when I came close
to him in my blind search.</p>

<p>“Well, how goes it?” I inquired, with seeming
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“I think I’m better.” This through chattering
teeth. “But I’m aw-aw-awfully cold.”</p>

<p>“Get up. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>“I-I-I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t stay here,” I protested.
“You’d be frozen stiff before morning. We’ve
got to get back to that barn we passed.”</p>

<p>“A-a-aren’t you going to lie down, too?
We might keep each other warm.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” very emphatically. “Get
up, d’you hear, get up!”</p>

<p>Partly by sheer force I got him out of the
thing we had bought for a sleeping-bag. Already
the wet had penetrated in places. While
Wallace stood leaning against a tree, I groped
round for our knapsacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Carrying the double burden, which privilege
cost me another struggle with Wallace, I led
back over the ground which we had covered on
our way up, my friend lurching drunkenly by
my side. Then he fell and lay in a faint, but
recovered quickly. After I had got him on his
feet again, I kept his arm, supporting him as
much as I could. Every few hundred steps or
so he half collapsed, his knees doubling under
him. When this happened I let him slide to the
ground, thus to get some rest.</p>

<p>I do not know how often this had occurred
when I noticed something wrong about the road.
The clearing on the left, with stumps standing
black against white snow patches&mdash;surely I
could not have twice missed noticing it! The
ground, too, fell rather sharply. “Traveling
toward the Wesel road!” I thought. “I remember
no villages there, if I recollect the
map.”</p>

<p>Wallace had been sitting on the ground all
this time. I helped him to his feet and urged
him on: “We’ve got to be traveling! Up
hill now! Awfully sorry, old chap, but I missed
the road.”</p>

<p>Three rests, and the old track was under our
feet. Three more, and we were drawing near
to the little settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’ll not be very long now, old man; cheer
up!” I said encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Mus’ get into warmth. Knock first house
come to. Can’t stick it,” Wallace muttered in
reply.</p>

<p>“Try to make that barn, won’t you? It’s
close by.”</p>

<p>We came abreast of a house with a light in
the passage, which showed dimly through some
panes of glass above the front door. The time
must have been about 2:30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Wallace stopped and peered at it. “Is that
a house?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Knock!” and with a contented sigh he slid
to the ground.</p>

<p>I was not prepared to give up so soon. That
is what his command meant, as it appeared to
me. My pal moved and struggled into a sitting
position.</p>

<p>“Knock!” he repeated.</p>

<p>I knocked. No answer. I knocked again,
but less determined. The same result. The
third time my knuckles met the wood with a nice
regard for the sleepers inside. I did not intend
them to hear me; it was only for Wallace’s
satisfaction that I went through this performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>“They don’t hear,” I announced, having gone
back to my companion. “Come on, make another
effort. Let’s get to the barn. It’s only
a few more steps,” I urged.</p>

<p>“Did you knock?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, three times!” I replied, with veracious
if somewhat misleading detail, and I dragged
him up and on.</p>

<p>At last we reached it. Wallace was soon resting
in the same place as he did hours before,
while I went to get a ladder. Three of them
were wedged in on one side between a wheel of
the wagon and a support of the barn, and by the
compressed straw on the other. I tore, and
heaved, and struggled with berserk rage until
I got one out, the sweat pouring from underneath
my hat brim. It was an enormously
clumsy affair, and trying to rear it against the
barn and into the door opening off the loft, I
failed again and again by an inch or two. After
a brief rest I went at it again. The last inch
seemed unattainable. Another effort! Suddenly
it leaped right up and into position.
Turning in surprise, I saw my friend standing
behind me. His little strength had been added
to mine just at the right moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up first and have a look!” I told him.
The rear of the loft was four feet deep in clean-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>smelling
straw. Thank God for that! We
should be warm!</p>

<p>“Up you go!” I was on the ground again
to help Wallace up the ladder. He managed to
ascend it, and then pitched forward. I let him
lie and fetched our knapsacks. The ladder I
left in position for the time being. If a few
hours’ rest would improve my friend to such an
extent that it became feasible to “carry on”
during the following night, I intended to drag it
up after us, and hide it at the rear of the barn,
where I proposed to conceal ourselves. It
would not be missed on a Sunday.</p>

<p>A hearty heave and shove sent Wallace
sprawling on the straw. Soon I had a hollow
dug for him, into which he crawled, and I covered
him as best I could. Then I flung myself
down by his side, too fagged to care for overcoat
or covering.</p>

<p>Fighting against the drowsiness which immediately
stole over me, I must have fallen asleep
for a short spell, for I felt suddenly very cold.
Too tired to move immediately, I lay shivering,
listening to the dying wind and the faint beating
of snow against the thin walls and the roof of
our shelter. When the cold became intolerable,
I crawled with stiff joints into the corner where
I had flung our knapsacks, got my overcoat out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and put it on. The exercise cleared my dulled
brain, and I perceived that I had better look
after Wallace. His teeth were chattering when
I bent over him. As well as I could, I got him
warmer after a time. I now kept wide awake,
trying to piece together what was left of our
hopes.</p>

<p>I did not anticipate hearing any one stirring
in the few houses around until late daylight, and
dully wondered at the sound of voices which
penetrated to our hiding-place, hours before
some chinks in the roof showed faintly gray.
We could not see the door from where we rested.</p>

<p>With an effort I turned to Wallace. “Are
you awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel you’ve got to get into warmth?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That means going to a farm and meeting
people!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Poor Wallace! His voice sounded so flat and
tired! I have often wondered since whether I
ought not to have made another effort to keep
him where he was, and to proceed with him the
next night. He might have stood it. I don’t
think he quite realized what it meant getting
into shelter. I believed at the time that he did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
However, I acted according to my lights, without
another word.</p>

<p>Sliding from the straw I approached the door,
to stop in wonder for a moment before going
down the ladder. Long icicles had grown from
the upper edge of the opening almost to the
floor of the loft in the few hours we had been
inside, and between them the cold light of a
winter morning, strongly reflected by a white,
unbroken surface, met my eyes. It was eight
o’clock by my watch. The icicles snapped with
a glassy sound and fell noiselessly outside when
I broke through their curtain.</p>

<p>Beyond it the world was white,&mdash;the ground,
as far as I could see it; the air, thick with dancing
flakes; and the sky. What mattered it now
whether we stayed in the loft or sought the shelter
of a farm?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GAME IS UP</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The farmhouse door was opened by a girl
of about sixteen, who turned back into the
kitchen to call her mother, a woman whom incessant
toil seemed to have aged beyond her years.</p>

<p>“May I speak to your husband?” I asked
politely.</p>

<p>“He’s not at home.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect him soon?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s away,”&mdash;hesitating&mdash;“at Haltern.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, it’s this way. I am with a friend.
We came from Bremen yesterday, and we’re on
our way to Cologne for a holiday. We’ve relatives
living at Klein Recken, and thought of
spending a few days with them. We tried to
walk there last night from Haltern, but in the
awful weather we lost the road. My friend fell
ill, too. Fortunately, we found your barn, and
slept in the straw. We’ll pay, of course, for
what damage we did. But the question is this:
Can you put us up for a day or two, until my
friend gets really better? We’ll pay you well,
if you would.”</p>

<p>“You can’t stay here that long, but you may
come into the kitchen and warm yourself. You
may stay until twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>I reflected. A few hours’ grace! We had
better take it and see how things turned out.</p>

<p>“All right,” I said. “I’ll fetch my friend
and our knapsacks.”</p>

<p>With the assistance of the son of the house, a
strong lad about fifteen years of age, I got
Wallace into the kitchen. We were given seats
in front of the roaring kitchener. My friend
seemed much better.</p>

<p>Our arrival was obviously an extraordinary
event, as well it might be; but if the people did
conjecture at all, they showed it only in a suppressed
kind of excitement. There was no atmosphere
of suspicion, and the few curious questions
the woman asked us were easily parried.</p>

<p>There were three girls and the boy in the
family, all approaching maturity. While the
woman bustled about preparing a breakfast for
us, two of the girls and the boy made ready to
go out. I did not like that, and tried to find
out where they were going.</p>

<p>“You’re going to church, I suppose?” This
to the eldest girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” shyly.</p>

<p>“Have you got one near by?”</p>

<p>“No. We go to Haltern to church. My sister
will be back soon from the first service.”
So there was a fourth girl!</p>

<p>“Did she go to Haltern, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It seems a long way to walk on a day like
this.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“You do get up early, even on Sundays, don’t
you? I thought I heard you about very early,
this morning.”</p>

<p>“We get up at five o’clock,” broke in the old
woman.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so. I always thought there
was little farm work to be done in winter. You
don’t seem to take advantage of your slack
time.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots to do.” And she ran through
a list of duties.</p>

<p>“Do you feel the war as much as we do in
town? How are you off for food?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>“We manage all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t. We’re chemists in an ammunition
factory, and we’re worked to death
and don’t get much to eat. There’s nothing
one can buy. We applied for a holiday, being
tired of the everlasting long hours, and got
three weeks. A bit too late for Muller, here.
He oughtn’t to have come, feeling as he did.”</p>

<p>The coffee was brewed, and bread, butter, and
a plate of cut sausage were on the table. Both
of us went at it cheerfully. In the middle of
the meal the fourth girl, the eldest, came in,
and the boy and his two sisters left. This was
about half-past nine.</p>

<p>When I had an opportunity, I whispered to
Wallace: “We’ve got to get away from here
soon after eleven. Play up.” Then I addressed
him aloud: “What do you think we’d
better do?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know. I feel pretty rotten still.”</p>

<p>Turning to the woman, I asked: “It’s about
two and a half hours to Klein Recken, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“About that.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can manage that, Muller?”
I looked seriously at Wallace, who understood
and answered, equally serious:</p>

<p>“No; I’m afraid it would be too much for
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, we had better go back to Haltern
and on to Cologne from there. Let me see
what train we can catch.” Luckily we had kept
our time-table. It came in handy now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>“There’s a train at eleven-fifty-four to
Cologne. We might catch that, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“Anything you like, Erhardt.”</p>

<p>“Right-o.” To the woman: “How long do
you reckon to the station in Haltern from
here?”</p>

<p>“You can do it in a little over three quarters
of an hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I make it. We’ll leave here at
eleven.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A dollar and a quarter seemed to satisfy the
old woman. Indeed, she obviously had not expected
so much, but she quickly hid the money
in her purse. Then we took our leave.</p>

<p>The weather had cleared somewhat. It was
freezing slightly. The clouds were thinning
here and there, and an occasional ray of sunshine
drifted over the landscape. It was a regular
Christmas picture. Two or three inches of
snow covered the ground, reflecting strongly the
dispersed light from the sky. Black and
sharply defined, the woods were outlined against
it or the unblemished white of the fields, where
they stretched up the hillsides behind them.
Each branch had a ridge of snow on its upper
surface, and looked as if it had been drawn with
India ink and a sharp-pointed pen on glazed pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>per.
The boughs of the dark-green pines were
bending under masses of downy white, lumps of
which slid to the ground as we passed. Then
the boughs, relieved from part of their load,
swayed upward.</p>

<p>“You see why I wanted to be off,” I explained
to Wallace as soon as we were out of earshot,
glad to drop back into English, since nobody
was about. “Our unexpected appearance at
the farm was sufficiently extraordinary to make
the girls serve it up hot and strong to their
friends in Haltern. It’ll fly round the town
like bazaar talk, and we’d have had the police
coming for us in a couple of shakes. But what
now?”</p>

<p>We talked it over. Again Wallace asked me
to leave him, but my stern answer silenced his
arguments. Again it was he who urged “carrying
on,” although he admitted that to walk any
distance was out of the question for him. He
submitted a plan which did not strike me as particularly
hopeful, but it was the best we could do
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>We were to go back to a certain town in Germany,
get help there, and rest in security until
Wallace’s condition and the weather had improved
sufficiently to make another attempt
feasible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Our exchequer was at low water, and I had
my doubts whether we could reach the town.
But we might try.</p>

<p>Sundry groups of people were coming from
Haltern; some of them stared rather hard at
us. Wallace was improving, and enjoyed the
walk, but he seemed very weak, and his feet hurt
him so that he limped painfully along.</p>

<p>The weather changed again for the worse, and
as we approached the station it began to snow.
I took tickets to a junction not far off. During
the twenty minutes until the train was
due we intended to wait on the platform.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wait in the waiting-room?
It’s beastly on the platform,” said the ticket-collector.</p>

<p>“Might as well,” I said indifferently, and
turned back.</p>

<p>We took our seats and ordered coffee. At
the counter opposite us stood a young lieutenant
in the long green, peace frock-coat of a rifleman.
We saw the ticket-collector come in and
address him, whereupon the lieutenant walked
straight up to us.</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p>“We walked in from Klein Recken this morning,”
I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Show me your papers!”</p>

<p>I smiled and addressed Wallace in English:
“Game’s up, old man!” He nodded glumly.
The lieutenant stared. Then I explained.</p>

<p>The officer did not seem very much surprised,
and the miraculous way in which an armed soldier
appeared at his elbow showed that he had
been expecting a dénouement.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to send you to the guard-room at
present,” he said. “Don’t try any tricks. My
men are hellishly sharp.” I reflected a moment.
Escape was out of the question for the
present. Wallace’s condition, the tracks we
should leave in the snow, etc., would make an
attempt absurd.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you will accept our
word that we sha’n’t run away while in your
charge. We’ll give it, if you like. That’s
right, Wace, isn’t it?” I turned to my friend
with the last words. Wallace nodded.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had been in the act of turning
away, but wheeled sharply when I had spoken.
Looking us over carefully, he said: “Right, I
will. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“We could do with something to eat,” Wallace
spoke up for the first time. The officer
turned to his soldier:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will take these men to the guard-room.
Leave your rifle here. They are to have double
rations of whatever you get.”</p>

<p>“Besten Dank, Herr Leutnant!” we acknowledged.</p>

<p>With a salute we turned and followed the soldier
across the railway lines to the guard-room.
It was in a wooden hut, and similar to all other
guard-rooms. We had a wash and made ourselves
as presentable as possible. Wallace
shaved. I was still wearing a beard.</p>

<p>About five o’clock the lieutenant came over to
search us. Warning us to give up everything of
importance, he merely asked us to hand him
what we had in our pockets, and glanced through
our knapsacks.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we were taken to his office in
the station building, escorted by two armed soldiers.</p>

<p>“You gave me your word that you were not
going to make another attempt!” the lieutenant
reminded us.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as long as we are in your charge,
or that of your men.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>“Good. I shall have to send you to prison
now. I can’t keep you in the guard-room.
Don’t let the warder search you. I’ve done
that. You are military prisoners, not under
civil authority. If you prefer it, try to make
him give you a cell where you can be together.
Tell him I said you were to have one. You’ll
be here for a few days before an escort can be
got for you. Good-by.”</p>

<p>He called our escort in while we stood outside,
nobody, seemingly, heeding us in the least.
When he had finished with the two soldiers, we
marched off. They were particularly nice
chaps from the Rhine, not proper Prussians,
and largely influenced by socialistic ideas.
They twitted us good-humoredly about having
been caught. Laughing and joking, we arrived
at our destination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The old prison building in a narrow side street
near the market-place looked particularly uninviting.
After much ringing of the bell and, at
last, thumping with the butt end of a rifle, the
door opened, and we were confronted by a large,
flabby-looking man in uniform, with the placid,
unlined face of a person whose life had flowed
past him like a pleasant, quiet stream. He was
something between a policeman and a warder,
as it appeared. At the moment he was smoking
a long pipe with a porcelain bowl.</p>

<p>Our arrival agitated him as much as his natural
phlegm and his military training would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
permit. For a time he seemed undecided what
to do, and repeated over and over again every
one of his sentences. This was a trick of his,
which amused us considerably during the days
we were under his care, but made conversation
slow and unprofitable. As he collected his wits,
he became more official.</p>

<p>“So, two Englishmen, are they? They are
two Englishman, they are. You’ve brought
two Englishmen. Well, well, well! Where are
their papers? Have you got their papers? You
must give me their papers. They are not quite
in order; no, no; they are not in order; no, they
are not in order.”</p>

<p>The soldiers explained patiently that they
were.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! Do they speak German?
They speak German, I hope.” To us: “Do
you speak German?</p>

<p>“Well, well, I must search you, my men. I
must search you, I must; I must search you.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said one of our escort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> “the lieutenant
says they are not to be searched. The
lieutenant saw to that. And you’ve got to do
the best you can for them, and you are to put
them in a cell together. Orders from the lieutenant!”</p>

<p>“Well, I must search them,” repeated the
warder helplessly. “I must search them, you
know; prison rules, you know. I must search
them for concealed weapons!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort. They were searched,
and we’ve got orders to see that you don’t
bother them again.”</p>

<p>“Have you any knives, pistols, revolvers, or
other weapons on you?” Stubbornly the
warder had turned to us. The habit of years is
not so easily discarded.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s give him our pocket-knives, Wace,
and get it over,” I said, half laughing, half annoyed.</p>

<p>“Come into this room; come in here; come
into this room. Now I’ll enter the articles in
this book; yes, I’ll enter them in this book.”
He began to write, speaking the words aloud:
“No. 000000, one ivory-handled pocketknife.
No. 000001, one horn-handled pocketknife.…
Now, I’ll give them back to you when you
leave, you see; I’ll give them back to you when
you leave; yes, I’ll give them back to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we want to get back ourselves,”
said one of the soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> “Hurry up and show
us their cell. We are to have a look at it, the
lieutenant said.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right, all right! I’ve got a
single cell will do for the two of them; a single
cell for the two; yes, for the two.”</p>

<p>At last we were in the cell, which was of
course as dark as the nether regions, having
taken quite an affectionate farewell of our escort.</p>

<span class="smaller">FOOTING THE BILL</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The lieutenant at the station, by his orders
to us and the soldiers, had given us the
cue for our behavior. Obviously, we must try
to impress the warder with our standing as
“military prisoners,” in order to be as comfortable
as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>We proceeded to do this with great ingenuousness.
Long arguments and counter-arguments
secured us the use of an oil lamp until eight
o’clock at night. We went in force to obtain a
second blanket, the warder leading the procession.</p>

<p>Our cell was very small, and very dirty.
What little space there ought to have been was
taken up by stacks of old bicycle tires, which
had been confiscated six months before by the
Government to relieve the rubber famine in the
army.</p>

<p>During the three days we spent in Haltern
prison we had no exercise at all. When the
weather changed on the second day, and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
mild again, just about the time when we should
have been close to the frontier if everything
had gone well, we sulked with fate more than
ever.</p>

<p>The reported arrival of our escort on the evening
of the third day excited the warder to
such an extent that he wanted us to get up at
half-past five the next morning in order to catch
a train about eight o’clock. We demurred, of
course, and got our way, as usual. Ever since
our arrest we had devoted a good deal of time
to weighing the probability of being sent to a
certain penal prison in Berlin.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to take us?” Wallace
and I blurted out simultaneously at two shadowy
soldiers in the dark passage of the prison
the following morning.</p>

<p>“To where you came from, the Stadtvogtei in
Berlin,” one of them replied. To say we felt
relieved is putting it mildly.</p>

<p>“We’d better not take it for granted that
we are going to stay there, though!” I said, as
we tramped through the melting slush to the
station.</p>

<p>Several hours later, after a change of trains,
Wallace and I had been put temporarily into a
compartment with other travelers, until it could
be cleared for the exclusive use of ourselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
escort. Slipping into the only two empty seats,
we found the burning interest of our fellow-travelers
centered upon a man in the naval uniform
of the Zeppelin service, who was holding
forth about his adventures over England.
With extraordinary frankness he was recounting
the names of a number of air-ship stations,
and the number of Zeppelins usually detailed
from each for attacks on Great Britain, and
predicting another raid seven days later.</p>

<p>“You give them h&mdash;&mdash; every time you fly
across, don’t you?” asked a civilian, leaning
far forward in his seat.</p>

<p>“Can’t say that there is much to boast about
of late,” was the unexpected reply. “They’ve
plenty of guns, and can shoot quite as well as
we. There won’t be many more raids after
the one coming off next week.”</p>

<p>As we saw in the German newspapers eight
days later the raid took place as predicted, and
it was the last air-ship raid for a very long
time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To be in the company of a friend, and to have
some money in my pocket, made all the difference
between this and my first return from the
neighborhood of the Dutch frontier eight
months before. We did ourselves quite well on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the journey, trying to discount in this way the
punishment awaiting us.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that evening we were welcomed
to the Stadtvogtei by several of our old N. C.
O.’s with roars of laughter, and conducted to
two adjoining criminal cells in “Block 14,” a
long way from our friends.</p>

<p>Before my eyes had become quite accustomed
to the darkness, my cell door opened again, and
our sergeant-major beckoned me to follow him.</p>

<p>“Take your things with you!” he said, and
led the way to another cell, farther along the
corridor, to separate me from Wallace.</p>

<p>“Come out here! I want to talk to you!” he
ordered, when I had dumped down my luggage.
“Who had the key?” he shot at me when I stood
opposite him in the corridor.</p>

<p>We had expected this, and before our escape
had rehearsed our answers to such questions in
case one or more of us should be caught.</p>

<p>“Key? What key?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The key to the front door, of course!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about a key.”</p>

<p>“How did you get out, then? How did you
open the door?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>“We didn’t open the door. We found it
open. It seemed too good an opportunity, so
we slipped out as we were. We weren’t prepared
at all! But you ought to know all this
as well as I do. Haven’t you got your report
from Haltern yet?”</p>

<p>His manner changed. He became quite paternal.
He wasn’t a bad chap. Anyway, he
knew he couldn’t screw anything out of us by
turning rough. “Now, come! Don’t try to
hoodwink me. We know well enough it was S.
who had the key.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you know, why do you ask me?”</p>

<p>“Come on, tell me. It won’t be to your disadvantage!
quite the reverse. Just say it was
S.”</p>

<p>But of course I did nothing of the sort, and
he gave it up.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you a hard time of it, this
journey,” he threatened, rather mournfully.
“Nothing but the prison food for you, no light
of an evening.</p>

<p>“I thought you had shaved off your beard,”
he remarked, before turning away. “I notified
the police accordingly within the hour of your
escape. We had all the stations watched.
However did you slip out of Berlin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather casually,” I grinned. “Goodnight,
Major!”</p>

<p>I felt by no means sprightly and unconcerned
just then. I do not like solitary confinement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
The stretch in front of me bade fair to exceed
in discomfort the first one I had had. Still, we
were lucky to be in the Stadtvogtei, near our
friends, where, apparently, we were going to
stay. With this consolatory reflection I rolled
myself into my blankets without undressing.
The next day we were going to be de-loused.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>S. was arrested in Berlin on the morning
following our arrival in prison, and lodged in a
cell next to Wallace’s before we went into the
yard for our exercise that afternoon. If I am
not mistaken, a telephone conversation, during
which he had made an appointment with a
“friend,” had been listened to. Instead of a
friend, a detective met S.</p>

<p>He got the same punishment as we did. At
the time of his escape a criminal action had been
pending against him. A month after our solitary
confinement had come to an end, he was
taken to the court one morning by a policeman.
A few hours later the policeman turned up alone,
considerably the worse for drink, and shedding
bitter tears. His charge had decamped through
the rear window of a café where he had been
treating his escort. We never saw him again.
He was still at liberty in June, 1917, and apparently
in Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>G. was never captured. For several months
rumors reached us that he had been seen here
or there in Germany. I have not heard that he
has arrived in England.</p>

<p>The German with the English name went to
see his mother one day, two months after his
disappearance from prison. The police were
watching her flat in Berlin, hoping for just that
event. Their prey got a term of solitary confinement
in our prison, and was then drafted
back into the army.</p>

<p>The sixth man, the German stockbroker, followed
S. by a few days only. He was kept in
prison for a week, and then definitely set at
liberty.</p>

<p>On the evening of our second day in cells, we
were warned not to go to bed, as our examination
was to take place at nine o’clock. A quarter
before the hour, S., Wallace, and I were
taken down to the ground floor and thoughtfully
locked into one cell, so that we were able to
make the final arrangements for a consistent
and uncontradictory account. This we did after
a thorough inspection of the place which convinced
us that no trap had been laid for us, and
that we could talk freely until we should hear
the key in the lock.</p>

<p>The following morning we were told of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
comment of Herr Kriegsgerichtsrat Wolf of the
Kommandantur, who conducted the examination,
upon our respective stories: “Those Englishmen
have told me a pack of lies!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The threat of the sergeant-major had not been
an empty one. We were forbidden to have any
food apart from the prison rations. Every
third day for four weeks these consisted only of
bread and water, so far as we were concerned.
The parcels arriving for us in the meantime&mdash;there
were many of them, for Christmas was approaching&mdash;were
handed to our friends for safekeeping.
We were debarred from the use of
artificial light in our cells. It being within a
month from the shortest day in the year, this
was rather “off.” The dawn did not peep
through the small windows before nine o’clock,
and when we returned from the yard in the afternoon,
it was again too dark to read. I think
it took the authorities ten days to relent on
the question of light. We then got the use of
an oil lamp up to eight o’clock every night.</p>

<p>I feel quite sure that we had to thank the lieutenant
for the extra punishment of criminal
cells, prison food, and no light. He must have
been badly rattled about our escaping, and his
superiors may have been ungentle with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
when he reported it. Naturally, he took it out
on us, though to our faces he was quite polite.</p>

<p>The question of food was solved to our complete
satisfaction within three days. Our
friends knew, of course, that we were going for
our exercise every afternoon at three o’clock.
From the very beginning they were able to pass
us sandwiches and small cans of food.</p>

<p>Not without a little difficulty the N.C.O. in
charge of our corridor had been persuaded that
“they are allowed to have their newspapers, of
course.” His referring the question to higher
authority had been discouraged. Why bother
busy men with trifles? The newspaper man was
one of us. He brought the papers round every
morning, when the cell doors were opened for
cleaning purposes, and also every afternoon.
Frequently he did not exchange a word with us
but simply pushed the papers into the blankets
of our beds. After he had gone, sandwiches
and a beer bottle full of hot tea seemed to have
been hatched miraculously among our bed-clothes.</p>

<p>The last and crowning achievement was the
ventilator dodge. The ventilator was a square
hole in the wall above the door, inclined toward
the cell. Just after our dinner time, when the
N.C.O. on duty was likely to be otherwise em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ployed,
stealthy footsteps might have been heard
passing rapidly along the balcony. Very frequently
they were inaudible even to our strained
ears. The scraping of tin against stone was a
signal for us to hurl ourselves toward the door,
to catch the Lyle’s syrup can, filled with hot
meat and vegetables, or soup, which was sliding
through the ventilator.</p>

<p>None of the N.C.O.’s knew about this. They
marveled at our physical endurance, which permitted
us to retain a flourishing appearance in
the face of starvation. Sagely they counseled
the taking of medicine, or soap for instance, to
make us look weak and pale just before our “solitary”
was to terminate. “It’ll never do to be
seen with bulging cheeks and bursting seams by
anybody in command.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The chance of seeing old friends, if only for a
few seconds every day, the knowledge that I
should have their companionship again as soon
as our punishment was over, and the fact that
I was in familiar surroundings, lessened the depressing
effect of my solitary confinement this
second time. Wallace, too, kept in fairly good
spirits. Nevertheless, I came to the conclusion
that the game was not worth the candle. I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Wallace of my decision as soon as I could.
When we were again in front of the gate I qualified
it: “Never again, Wace, never again&mdash;except
during the mild seasons, and when the
chances are as good as I can make ’em.”</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, the thirty-fourth day of
our punishment, we were liberated, but we had
to sleep in the criminal cells for some time afterward.</p>

<p>In time, however, Wallace got the single cell
he coveted, and I, after three weeks, again
joined my old friends in the big cell. For a
fortnight dear old K. was the fourth man.
Then he was sent to Ruhleben. Wallace was the
fifth member of the mess, a sort of day-boarder.</p>

<p>A week after K. had left us, most of the Englishmen
got into trouble. As a punitive measure
we were ejected from the large common
cells, and C., L., Wallace, and I were lodged as
far apart as possible. C. and I were warned to
be ready to go to a penitentiary. W. received
“solitary” for an indefinite time. Another
fortnight, and all our intimate friends were sent
back to Ruhleben. Only those members of the
English colony who preferred prison to the
camp, and four escapers, who had made two attempts,
remained in the Stadtvogtei&mdash;ten in all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
But for Dr. Béland and one other prisoner, Wallace
and I were almost confined to each other’s
society.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had a fairly miserable time of it. The
loss of most of our companions had unsettled
us. To crown our misery, we were officially informed
that we could not hope ever to be returned
to camp, or even a camp, as we were considered
dangerous to the German Empire.</p>

<p>The announcement ought to have made us
feel rather proud. As we knew it to be only
one of their specious arguments, it did nothing
of the sort. Very soon I left it entirely out of
my calculations. Wallace did not, however, but
continued to attach importance to it. I must
say this, in order to explain my later attitude
toward another attempt to escape from prison.
In the course of months I grew more and more
convinced that we should go back to camp one
day. Then would come our chance! I cannot
explain my conviction. It was a “hunch.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our belief, however, that we should have to
wait did not serve as an excuse for inaction.
Wallace and I pushed our preparations for the
next escape as fast as possible, which was incredibly
slow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Our mainstay was an N.C.O. employed in the
office. He was a queer individual, one of the
plausible sort. His favorite saying characterized
him sufficiently: “<em>Eine Hand waescht die
andere</em> [one hand must wash the other].” His
saving grace was the entirely frank attitude as
to his outlook upon life and its obligations&mdash;lack
of obligations, in his case. Through him
we were able to take one great step forward&mdash;to
procure maps. In the first part of this volume
I have mentioned that the sale of maps to
persons without a permit from the General Staff
was forbidden in Prussia. According to the
statement of our friend he got us the maps we
wanted from a “relative” of his, who happened
to be a bookseller. “He had these maps in
stock and had forgotten to register them.”
One or two of them were indeed slightly shop-soiled.
They were good maps, covering a part
of Germany from Berlin, and including it to the
Dutch frontier. Their price&mdash;well, it made
my eyes water. They were worth it, though.
For a prisoner of war the collection must have
been unique. We each had a compass.</p>

<p>Chiefly on my advocacy we postponed the
start again and again. The chances of getting
away from prison were, to my mind, infinitesimally
small. One attempt by another party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
early in May was cleverly nipped in the bud.
Our last attempt had not encouraged me to
trust to luck, but I clung to my belief in a return
to Ruhleben, which appeared as unlikely
as ever, on the face of things. Once, however,
we were ready to go, but almost at the last minute
the help we had reckoned upon was not
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Among the men who had tried their luck in
May, 1917, were two who, very pluckily, had
started to walk the whole distance between Ruhleben
and the Dutch border. Unsuitable maps,
in the first place, had been their undoing. They
both spoke German&mdash;one like a native, the other
not so well. They do not wish to be known, so,
for the purpose of this narrative I will call them
Kent and Tynsdale.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Tynsdale is a friend of mine. His pal Kent and he
are good men. Do your best for them.&mdash;X.</p>

</div>

<p>This, penciled on a slip of paper and addressed
to Wallace and me, was given to us by
Tynsdale soon after his arrival. The brief
phrase did not overstate their merits.</p>

<p>Tynsdale was small, wiry, and, at times, very
reticent; Kent, tall, bulky, and&mdash;not reticent.
In due course we came to live in a large cell
together. They were as eager as were Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and I for a new venture, but they were quite
determined not to break prison. The information
they gave us about Ruhleben from the escaper’s
point of view strengthened my prejudices
against this course.</p>

<p>“Let’s wait a little longer. The weather will
be favorable until October. If our hopes should
prove vain, we can always make a desperate
sortie. Before it comes to that, something may
happen.” This was the final conclusion we arrived
at.</p>

<p>Something did happen&mdash;several things, in
fact.</p>

<p>The first was an unexpected visit from a representative
of the Dutch Legation in Berlin.
It found us well prepared with an impressive
protest against being kept in prison any longer.
The same evening I confirmed the interview in
two identical and rather lengthy letters, to
which almost all of us, including the five men
then in “solitary,” subscribed their signatures.</p>

<p>One of these letters was delivered to the Dutch
Minister by hand twenty-four hours after it had
left the Stadtvogtei in the pocket of a person
entirely unconnected with the postal service,
military or otherwise. Consequently the German
censor had no chance of perusing it. The
other passed through the ordinary channels un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>til
it was, presumably, decently buried in the
censor’s waste-basket.</p>

<p>A little later, German newspapers mentioned
the fact that negotiations about the treatment
of prisoners of war had taken place at The
Hague, and that an agreement had been come
to which was now awaiting ratification by the
governments of Great Britain and Germany.</p>

<p>It so happened that at this time we had unusual
facilities for the secret purchase of English
newspapers. In a copy of the “Daily Telegraph”
we read that the agreement had been
ratified. Another week passed and a copy of
the same paper contained paragraphs concerning
civilian prisoners of war. The report of a
speech in the House of Lords by Lord Newton,
I believe, either in the same paper or in some
other bought at the same time, helped us to interpret
these paragraphs so far as they seemed
to refer to cases like ours. At any rate, it gave
us a talking-point in favor of an interpretation
as we should have liked it, and announced further
that the agreement had become operative
in England on August 1, 1917, already a few
days past.</p>

<p>A memorial in the shape of two letters addressed
to the Dutch Minister in Berlin was
the immediate result of reading these articles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
The letters went the same way as the former
ones, and drew a good deal of good-natured
chaff upon my head about “writing-sickness,”
“Secretary for Foreign Affairs,” and charges
to be made for every signature I came to collect
in future.</p>

<p>Tynsdale and Kent had not been away from
camp more than three months. They knew all
the ins and outs of it, including a good deal of
information not usually shouted from the house-tops.
Wallace and I, after an absence of thirty
and seventeen months respectively, were comparative
strangers to Ruhleben.</p>

<p>“Will you two come with Wallace and me?”
I asked our new friends one day. “I should
like to have your help in getting out of camp,”
I explained. “Later on I can probably be as
useful to you.” And I referred to my record
as an escaper, to my equipment, and to my <em>maps</em>.
They assented. They knew from previous discussions
that I was not entirely in sympathy
with their proposed route; or, rather, I had explained
to them what I thought to be the advantages
of a route I had in mind, which were confirmed
by their own information.</p>

<p>As it appeared desirable that each member
of the proposed expedition should be fully
equipped as far as essentials were concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
we set to work feverishly making tracings of
parts of our maps. We had to finish this work
while still in prison, because it would not be
possible to secure sufficient privacy in Ruhleben
for this kind of thing. Fortunately I had
anticipated something like this months before,
and possessed some colored inks and drawing-pens.
Tracing-paper I manufactured from thin,
strong white paper, which I treated with olive-oil
and benzene. We finished three copies before
we left prison, the original making the
fourth.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of August, 1917, a strong guard
of policemen escorted a highly elated batch of
British civilian prisoners through a part of Berlin,
then by rail to Spandau, and again, <em>per
pedes apostolorum</em>, to Ruhleben camp. We
were nineteen in all.</p>

<p>Four Britishers stayed behind voluntarily;
five more were in “solitary,” having recently
tried to escape and failed. Among the latter
was our old friend L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">RUHLEBEN AGAIN</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">We arrived in Ruhleben shortly before
noon, and were kept waiting for a long
time just inside the gates, for the good of our
souls. But then, the under dogs are always
kept waiting somewhere for the good of their
souls. So that was all right.</p>

<p>When our names had been called a number of
times, and some supposedly witty remarks had
been made by a sergeant, whose reputation in
camp was no better than it should be, we were
marched off to our barracks (No. 14), a wooden
one, and the last one toward the eastern end of
the camp, next to the “Tea House.”</p>

<p>Part of it was divided off by a solid partition
and enclosed by a separate wire fence. This
was the punishment place of the camp, called
“the Bird Cage.”</p>

<p>The other and larger part was empty;
had, in fact, been cleared that morning for our
reception, much to the disgust of the former inhabitants,
who had been very comfortable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
their home-made cubicles and corners. Now
the place was absolutely bare, except for the litter
of broken shelves and partitions on the floor.</p>

<p>We were still contemplating it doubtfully
when we received our orders: “Beds will arrive
presently. They are to be placed in two
rows in the center of the barracks. Nothing
shall be hung on the walls, or the beams and
supports. No partitions or corners will be
allowed. The barracks is to be kept bare, so
that the inmates can be seen at any hour of
the night. The electric light is to be kept burning
all night and must not be obscured in any
way.” Thus ran the gist of them.</p>

<p>We were pretty wroth. “Call that a return
to the privileges and liberties of an ordinary
prisoner of war?” rang our complaint.</p>

<p>At night our indignation broke forth again.
We had to be in bed by 10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> At 10:45 a
patrol of three privates and an N.C.O. came
to count us, tramping noisily round and round
in their ammunition boots, over the bare wooden
floor. Not much to complain about in that.
But they repeated it six times during the night,
and that was distinctly “off.” For many of us,
sleep, even during the intervals, was difficult on
account of the glaring brightness of the electric
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>Our barracks captain protested strongly
the captain of the camp. So did virtually
every member of the barracks privately, and
gradually this nuisance abated. The six times
we were disturbed dwindled down to four, then
to three; and sometimes we were inspected
only twice, when the patrol considerately kept
outside and counted us through the windows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our reception in Ruhleben was rather flattering.
I do not know how many new acquaintances
I made during the first fortnight; several
hundred, I should think. Now and again, inevitably,
I met a man who immediately told me
what he would have done “if I had been in your
shoes and got as far as you. They would never
have brought <em>me</em> back alive!”</p>

<p>I had only to look at my barracks companions
to see that we bore the prison stamp, and the
remarks of my friends did not give me a chance
to forget my own appearance. Compared with
the Ruhlebenites proper, we looked more like
animated corpses than living beings. Our faces
were ashen gray, even our lips had paled. The
skin around our eyes remained drawn and puckered,
until the eyes had accustomed themselves
again to the strong light of the open sky.</p>

<p>Prison life had taken its toll of our vitality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
particularly among the long-timers. For a few
hours the fresh air acted upon us like heady
wine, and during the following days it simply
sapped our strength.</p>

<p>Kent and Tynsdale were in comparatively
good condition. Wallace was bad, but had an
appetite, and recovered quickly. I was the
worst of the four. My physical condition did
not make me a desirable companion for an arduous
venture, and since we found it impossible
to “make a move” at once, as we had intended, I
deliberately set myself to repairing the damage
as quickly as I could. I took plenty of rest, and,
avoiding any but the gentlest exercise, grew
gradually stronger. About the middle of the
second week I started some very mild training.</p>

<p>Yet I still remained nervous and distraught;
more so than my companions, who showed signs
of the same trouble. It was, however, merely
the nervousness of inaction, for I was eager to
start. The camp was not even as desirable as
we had pictured it. Barracks No. 14 was far
less comfortable in every respect than the barracks
we had called our own before we made our
first attempt. Everything was dirty, and we
missed our accustomed privacy. The two daily
roll-calls, which took place on the playing-field
at seven o’clock in the morning and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
twelve hours later, were an unmitigated nuisance.</p>

<p>What, then, could be more tempting than to
woo Fortune again? If she proved fickle, we
would go back to the Stadtvogtei. Under the
new arrangement the punishment for a “simple
escape” by a military prisoner was to be a fortnight’s
imprisonment. At first we interpreted
the paragraph as applying to civilian prisoners
also. Now we had become more doubtful about
it. Our friends, who had been sent to prison
after the 1st of August, had more than doubly
exceeded the stipulated time before we left the
camp. What more likely than that the Germans
would treat the agreement as another “scrap of
paper” and send us to comfortable winter quarters,
if we were caught?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had intended to start within a few days of
our arrival in camp. This we found impossible,
but for two reasons the delay was fortunate. It
permitted us to recruit our health and get accustomed
to the open air, and it brought us
nearer to the time of the new moon in the middle
of September.</p>

<p>About a week after our arrival, Wallace decided
not to come with us. For months he had
had a plan of his own, which recommended itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
neither to Tynsdale, Kent, nor me. He rather
liked the idea of playing a lone hand, and his
strong desire to see a little more of his friends
in Ruhleben finally decided him. Tynsdale,
Kent, and I “carried on.”</p>

<p>Our plans were simple enough, once we had
got out of camp. First of all we intended to
make for Berlin. From the capital a railway
journey of about twenty hours (including a
break of seven) was to take us to a small town
in the northwestern part of Germany, sixty kilometers
from the Dutch frontier as the crow flies.
From there we intended to walk, the distance by
road being rather more than seventy miles.
One considerable river would have to be crossed,
we did not quite know how, but we were all
fairly powerful swimmers.</p>

<p>Tynsdale’s knowledge of German was not
good enough to make it possible for him to
travel on the railway without a companion to do
the talking. Kent, his particular chum, was
more than willing to take the risk of being Tynsdale’s
courier, and proposed that he and his
friend should always travel in one compartment,
while I traveled alone in another. This arrangement
was obviously unfair. Granted the
wisdom of traveling in two parties, Kent would
be taking the greater risk all the time. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
finally agreed that Tynsdale was to be alternately
in Kent’s and my charge.</p>

<p>We had maps and compasses. I had a water-bottle
and a knapsack, and Kent obtained another
knapsack in camp. A third and two
water-bottles would have to be bought en route.</p>

<p>Ordinary wearing apparel, dictated by the
railway journey, we had; also sufficient underclothes
for cold weather, and two thick overcoats
between us. Two oilsilks of mine would protect
my friends on rainy days. I insisted on
carrying a heavy naval oilskin, sufficiently large
to make a decent ground-cloth for the three of
us. If possible, we intended carrying food for
ten days; cabin-biscuits, dripping, compressed
beef, chocolate, cocoa-and-milk powder, sugar,
and raisins.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, whom I have mentioned several
times in this narrative, spoke to me one
morning. “Take,” he began oracularly and
with a twinkle in his eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> “a pound of real
Scotch oatmeal, a pound of dripping, and a
pound of sugar. Mix well. Roll out the dough
until it is about three quarters of an inch thick,
and bake it in a hot oven for four hours. The
result will resemble shortbread. It is immensely
sustaining. That it will crumble easily
into a coarse powder need concern you only in
so far as you will have to carry it suitably
wrapped. Handkerchiefs will do. At a pinch,
a cake per day, smaller than your hand, will keep
you going indefinitely. And,” he added readily,
“if you’ll give me the material, I’ll do them
for you. But mind you chew ’em well when
you eat ’em. It’ll take some time to masticate
them properly. You must do that, to get the
full benefit of the oatmeal.”</p>

<p>The square cakes, a little smaller than the
palm of a man’s hand, which he handed to us in
a parcel a few days after, were rather heavy for
their size. We thought of carrying ten per man,
reduced the biscuits to two per day, and discarded
meat and cocoa altogether.</p>

<p>To carry all this during the railway journey,
we had a cheap German portmanteau, which I
had bought for this purpose in prison, and two
small leather hand-bags. As to money, I was
fairly well supplied. My companions got hold
of smaller sums, and between us we had enough
even for an emergency.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime we managed to be seen together
as little as possible. Escaping was in
the air. Two attempts from other barracks
failed during the first fortnight. What was
worse for us, three men from our barracks took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the bit in their teeth and went one night. They
were in cells again before dawn.</p>

<p>The camp authorities were wide awake and
slowly strengthened the guards. More police
dogs were reported to be arriving almost daily.
(I doubt whether these reports were correct.)
N.C.O.’s patrolled the sentries incessantly, or
concealed themselves and watched places for
hours where they thought fugitives would pass.
As long as we knew beforehand where these
places were this did not matter much, but it
certainly increased my nervousness and impatience.
I believe I was a sore trial to my friends
with my incessant, irrational pleading for
“something to be done.”</p>

<p>Kent and Tynsdale had made their first escape
from camp by simply bribing the sentry at
the gate and one other, and walking out. We
had hoped to repeat this performance. Both
these sentries were still in camp on guard-duty.
Immediately after our arrival we sounded them
as to their willingness to earn a few hundred
marks easily. We did not do this ourselves,
but made use of the good offices of a friend of
Tynsdale’s, who had extensive dealings of a
different nature with the two German soldiers
and who could bring a good deal of pressure to
bear on them. To appreciate the importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the help he rendered us, it must be remembered
that no soldier was allowed to talk with a prisoner.
It would have been difficult for us to establish
direct communication with the two soldiers.
Not only was the punishment barracks
least suited for anything like secret meetings,
but its inmates were kept under more continuous
surveillance than the rest of the interned.</p>

<p>The two soldiers were quite willing to do business,
but maintained that the most they could do
was to take an entirely passive part. The old,
easy way was out of the question. The camp
authorities were too suspicious of the existence
of irregularities among the guards and of the
danger of fresh attempts now that the “gang”
was back in camp. “If we get certain posts, we
won’t challenge during a specified time,” was
what the soldiers gave us to understand.</p>

<p>The situation became worse when one of these
soldiers was suddenly sent to the front. His
manifold activities for the benefit of the prisoners&mdash;payment
being made with English food&mdash;had
at last got him into trouble. The other
man, his associate in most of the deals, went
about expecting the same fate and became quite
intractable for a few days. As nothing happened
to him, he gradually assumed his normal
state of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>We intended to leave camp at the western
corner. This was farther removed from the
escapers’ barracks and nearest to Spandau.
Our route was to lead us through part of Spandau.</p>

<p>A box in Barracks No. 8 was our headquarters.
There our equipment was kept, and there
we intended to dress.</p>

<p>The windows in the loft of Barracks No. 4
gave upon the enclosure of the Visitors’ Barracks.
They were about two feet square and
covered with wire netting which could easily be
removed. As the loft of this barracks was divided
into a large number of small cubicles, only
the inhabitants of one cubicle needed to be taken
into our confidence to any extent. They undertook
with alacrity to have everything ready at a
few hour’s notice, including the rope we should
have to descend by. Once in the enclosure of
the Visitors’ Barracks we should have only one
wire fence to climb to get into the space between
this and the outer wooden fence. The wire
fences consisted of strong chicken-wire with
barbed-wire strands along the top. They were
about eight feet high. The wooden fence extended
only a little way. The rest had been
destroyed by a fire which had occurred in camp
in June of that year. Along part of the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
we should be partially protected from the view
of the sentries by the wooden fence and the
structures about us.</p>

<p>There was a sunken path which was well
lighted by electricity, and well guarded. The
sentries walked on top of a bank and were able
to see most of the space between the wire and
the wooden fence. Post No. 2 was at the corner
of the wooden fence, where the path met the
road which ran along the front of the camp, and
extended along the path for about seventy
yards. Then came Post No. 3. The end of the
wooden fence was nearer to the road than to the
other end of Post No. 2.</p>

<p>The attempt was to be made when our man
was on duty. He was to be deaf and blind.
This would leave us free to concentrate our attention
upon Post No. 3.</p>

<p>“Next Sunday!” Kent told me at length on a
Friday. “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, man, I’ve been ready these
two weeks past!” Then I began to ruminate:
“Sunday? That’s rather awkward!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>“It is, but do you think we ought to delay it
on that account?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not! Does Tynsdale realize
the state of affairs?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t discussed them with him. If we
two come to an agreement, he’ll be sure to take
the same view.”</p>

<p>There were two objections to the day proposed&mdash;one
because it was a Sunday, which
made getting into Berlin rather risky, the other
because it happened to be the 16th of September,
which made getting away from the capital
additionally difficult.</p>

<p>As to Sunday, food was scarce in Germany,
especially in the capital, and illegal trading was
rife. Every Sunday the inhabitants flocked
into the country in multitudes to buy farm produce
from the peasants direct, offering prices
much higher than those fixed by law. To stop
this, the police frequently detained passengers
who were traveling into town on the trunk and
local railways, in the Underground, and on
trams, and inspected their baggage. A search
of our bags and bundles would mean immediate
arrest.</p>

<p>Secondly, at 2 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> on the 17th of September&mdash;the
Monday after the day we had chosen&mdash;summer
time was to change to astronomical
time. Consequently, trains all over the country
would leave independently of the printed timetables
during several hours before and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
hands of the clocks were moved back. Thus we
could not be sure whether or not we could catch
the train we had selected.</p>

<p>We came to the conclusion that we should have
to risk it. But could we not minimize the first,
the greater of the two risks, by reducing the
amount of our luggage? “We’ll take only one
of the small hand-bags, discard these and these
articles, and carry food for six days only,” we
decided.</p>

<p>The amount of food which we finally took with
us worked out per man per day as follows: a bar
of chocolate, two small cabin-biscuits with dripping,
one cake of the famous “escapers’ shortbread,”
two or three pieces of sugar, and half a
dozen raisins. A tin of Horlick’s malted milk
tablets was carried in reserve, and also a small
flask of brandy.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DAY</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">On the 16th of September, 1917, our man
was on guard at Post No. 2 from 7 till 9
<span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> and again four hours later. He had instructions
to expect something between 8 and 9
o’clock, or, failing that, during his next shift.
The latter part of his instructions had been an
afterthought. It was part and parcel of our
plan to catch the train from the Lehrter Bahnhof
in Berlin at 11:47 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> It would have inconvenienced
us very considerably if we had
had to delay our departure. If everything went
satisfactorily as far as the sentry was concerned,
he was to receive his reward the following
morning, no matter what happened to us.</p>

<p>That evening we were to be counted for the
last time that season at 7 o’clock. The roll-call
took place on the playing-field in the center of
the race-course. This was outside the strongly
protected camp proper, and it was beginning to
be too dark, at the hour mentioned, to let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
prisoners outside of any of the three wire fences
surrounding it.</p>

<p>As soon as the ranks broke after passing back
into the inner camp enclosure, we made our way
casually and separately to Barracks No. 8. The
box we entered was quite deserted. Two of its
inhabitants could be seen talking near one of the
entrances to the barracks, from where they
could hail any chance visitor who might intend
to look them up in their quarters. We dressed
as rapidly as possible, yet were somewhat later
in getting ready than we had expected to be.
Our baggage had been taken to the selected
cubicle in the loft of Barracks No. 4 during the
afternoon by men not specially interested in our
venture.</p>

<p>The cubicle of our friends was in darkness.
The open window opposite the wood-framed
pasteboard door admitted a faint rose-gray
after-glow from the western sky. The confined
space seemed crowded with dimly seen forms
who whispered that all was ready.</p>

<p>Somewhat perversely, I thought, Tynsdale
suddenly demanded that I accompany him “to
have a look at the gate.” It was a double gate,
plentifully protected by barbed wire, which gave
entrance to the enclosure of the Visitors’ Barracks
during the weekly half-hour when visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
were allowed to see the prisoners. Without
heeding my protest in the least he disappeared,
and I had to follow after.</p>

<p>“I think we had better climb over the gate
instead of dropping from the window,” was all
he answered to my questions about his unexpected
vagary. To my somewhat heated opposition
against any alteration in our oft-and well-considered
course of action he turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p>“I’m going to climb over here,” he announced
truculently after a brief inspection, and
almost immediately began to suit the action to
his words. As little attention as he had paid to
me, he paid less to some twenty or thirty men,
mostly sailors, who were lounging near the spot.
And then a very fine thing happened. As soon
as these men saw what Tynsdale was up to, and
without any perceptible hesitancy, they began
walking carelessly about and around him, shielding
his activities in this fashion more effectively
than they could have done by any other means.
As for myself, I hurried back to the loft.</p>

<p>“Come on,” I whispered breathlessly to Kent,
“quick! Tynsdale is climbing over the gate.
He’s stark, staring mad.” I grasped the rope,
squeezed through the window, and was in such
a hurry to get down that I let the rope slide
through my fingers. Naturally a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
skin stuck to the rope. I landed with a bump
and had just time to roll out of the way as
Kent’s two hundred pounds came crashing after
me. We got up, both with smarting palms,
while overcoats seemed to be raining from
the window above. We managed to catch
the two grips as they fell. During all this
time we could hear Tynsdale making a terrific
din among the wires. As soon as he had negotiated
the first two obstacles he started to
overcome the third fence, while Kent and I
carried our paraphernalia to the foot of it.
Then Kent went over the top, and I heaved
the things over to Tynsdale, who stood ready
to receive them. Kent was a heavy man, and
he appeared to me more than a little awkward
at that moment. How he ever managed
to get over the fence without bringing the whole
guard about our ears I cannot yet understand.
My own performance probably sounded as bad
to them.</p>

<p>As I let go my last hold, a stage-whisper from
the window about fifteen yards away, reached
our ears, “Drop, you fools, drop!” The men
in the loft could see the sentries over the top of
the intervening low wooden barracks. To judge
from the suppressed excitement in their voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
one of the sentries must have been coming our
way with much determination.</p>

<p>A patch of weeds on our left was the only
cover near us. Grabbing the second portmanteau,
which was still lying near the fence, I dived
for it headlong and fell down beside Kent.
Tynsdale, who had gone forward, beat a hasty
retreat toward us and disappeared from view
on Kent’s other side.</p>

<p>There we lay, out of breath, and dangerously
near the lower end. I did not dare to raise my
head even, and then after a long, long interval,
the suppressed voices sounded again, straight
from heaven: “All clear. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>We reached the end of the wooden fence.
The enemy sentry was nowhere to be seen. A
few quick, long steps carried us across the
sunken path, into the potato-field and beyond
the circle of the glaring electric lights. Kent
was in the lead. Suddenly he dropped, and we
followed his example just as the gate of the
soldiers’ barracks, perhaps fifty yards on our
left, clicked open. Then it slammed shut.</p>

<p>Potato-vines offer very good cover for a man
in a prone position. It was dark, too. But, lying
there, I had the uncomfortable feeling that
some large and conspicuous part of my anatomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
must be sticking out into plain view. I flattened
myself as much as possible and vainly tried to
decrease my bulk by general muscular contraction,
but seemed to swell to ever greater dimensions.
When I lifted my head after some
time I saw two round gray-and-black objects
above the potatoes. These were my companions.
We had all given way to the same impulse
at the same time. Nothing menacing was to be
seen. Silently we got to our feet and shortly
after gained the road.</p>

<p>From now on we were to play the parts of
harmless German civilians, and consequently
the need for silence had passed. “What made
that gate open and slam?” I asked Kent. “I
didn’t take the time to look, myself.”</p>

<p>“Two soldiers came out of the barracks and
went toward camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right, I suppose. You know
this road. You lead.”</p>

<p>Kent turned and walked off, closely followed
by Tynsdale and me. We had not taken many
steps when I suddenly saw the end of a cigarette
glow up in the dark ahead of us. Kent hesitated,
stopped, and whispered to us.</p>

<p>“Oh, go on!” I answered irritably. “We
can’t stop here.” Kent walked on and past two
soldiers standing by the roadside. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
stepped forward, barring our way. I made as
if to pass them, but they did not move aside to
make room.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” one of them
asked.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I countered.</p>

<p>“We want to know who you are and where
you come from.”</p>

<p>“What right have you to stop us in this fashion
and ask us questions?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by stopping anybody on
a public road?” Kent’s voice amplified my question.
I had not noticed that he had turned and
joined our group. “This is a public road, you
know.”</p>

<p>Tynsdale, who could not speak German very
well, kept discreetly behind Kent and me and
felt, no doubt, as if he were intruding.</p>

<p>“This isn’t an ordinary public road. There
is an English prison camp down that way. Our
instructions are to keep an eye on the traffic
along here, what there is of it.” It was always
the same man who was doing the talking. His
statement sounded a little odd to me since
neither he nor his companion was conspicuously
armed, and neither one wore a helmet, two
signs that they were not on duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> “Unless you
have a passport or can establish your identity by
some other means you will have to come with
us, so we can make sure who you are.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t a passport,” I said slowly.
“You don’t always require one just walking
back and forth from your work.” I was trying
to think of the right thing to do or to say, and
particularly whether to risk about ten years in
a penitentiary, if the only move which seemed
open to us should fail.</p>

<p>“Oh, anything will do,” the soldier continued,
“an envelop addressed to you, for example.”</p>

<p>I had made up my mind. “Right. I’ll give
you something. Here’s my passport,” and I
handed him a one-hundred-mark bill from my
pocket-book.</p>

<p>The soldier looked at the bill, then at me. He
poked his companion in the ribs with his elbow
and showed it to him.</p>

<p>“See what that fellow calls a passport? Is
that all right?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Boy, boy! You are some guys, you are!
Say, are you only going for a night in Berlin, or
are you not coming back?”</p>

<p>“That is as it may be,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Say, what barracks are you fellows from?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>“You needn’t worry about that yet. You’ll
hear all about that in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! But you beat it now, quick!”
and they turned to go. But I had an idea of
making further use of them.</p>

<p>“Say,” I called, “we want to get into Spandau.
Is it likely that we shall be stopped?
Are there many sentries about there? Which
is the best road to take?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. Walk straight on and then turn to
your left across the railway.” They went
away.</p>

<p>When I looked about for the grip, which I
had put down in order to get at my pocket-book,
I found it gone. Kent had walked on. Tynsdale
was still hovering close to me.</p>

<p>“Where’s that portmanteau?” I asked him
excitedly. “I put it down here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered. “Didn’t see
it at all. Where did you put it down?”</p>

<p>For a few seconds we looked underneath the
bushes without success. “A man who will take
a bribe will steal,” was a not unnatural conclusion
to come to.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” I flung over my shoulder,
and started in hot pursuit after the two soldiers.
It was the larger of our two grips that was
missing, containing the most important part of
our equipment.</p>

<p>“What the hell do you want now?” is the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
they received me. Neither one of them was carrying
anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” I replied airily. Being unable
to catch them in the act I dared not take
the risk of accusing them. “I thought I had
lost something,” I said.</p>

<p>The one who spoke muttered something
threateningly. They were naturally very anxious
to get rid of us now.</p>

<p>“Come along,” I said to Tynsdale, resignedly,
when I had rejoined him. “We’ve got to make
the best of it.” A little farther down the road
Kent was waiting for us in the shadow of a
bush, with both grips. He had picked mine up
when he started to walk ahead and had caused
me a few bad moments. Here, we brushed ourselves
with our hands and handkerchiefs. A
short walk through wide, deserted streets, most
of them flanked by factory buildings, proved
pleasantly unexciting.</p>

<p>It was still early in the evening, but the wide
thoroughfare of Spandau, not far from the railway
station, was deserted, except for a small
group of people between two tall light-standards,
who, like us, were waiting for a tram to
Berlin. The arc-lights fizzed slightly now and
again, and cast fleeting purple shadows over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
island, which served as a platform for the
tram-cars.</p>

<p>We three stood a little apart, occasionally exchanging
a word or two in German. We were
hot with excitement and exertion. I was carrying
the large portmanteau and an overcoat over
my arm. Kent had the other bag, Tynsdale an
oilsilk wrapped in his overcoat.</p>

<p>The first tram was crowded, but a second, immediately
behind, was only moderately full. As
prearranged, we got on the driver’s platform,
the darkest part of the vehicle, and the least
sought after.</p>

<p>For the first quarter of an hour of our ride,
tram-lines and street ran parallel to, but on the
other side of, the railway, which passed along
the front of the camp. The eastern gate of
Ruhleben camp was at one point not more than
two hundred yards from a stopping-place, where
officers and men of the camp-guard usually
boarded the trams when going to town. Hardly
half that distance away a sentry patrolled.</p>

<p>The possibility of an untoward meeting at
this point kept us on edge. If somebody from
Ruhleben had accidentally entered our car, we
intended to take no notice of it, unless he came
to the front platform. What we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
done in that case, I do not know. Our resourcefulness
was, fortunately, not put to the test.</p>

<p>The front platform became fairly crowded. I
succeeded in manœuvering Tynsdale into a corner,
and planted myself in front of him, thus cutting
him off from any likelihood of being spoken
to by any of the passengers. Kent could take
care of himself, better perhaps than I, for he
was readier with his tongue. Half-way to Berlin,
in front of West End Station, Charlottenburg,
where eighteen months ago my railway
journey had started, the track was blocked by a
car which had broken down. It took half an
hour to shunt it upon a siding and clear the
line. We were not pressed for time, and remained
in our places, almost the only passengers
who did so.</p>

<p>Our immediate destination was the Wilhelms
Platz in Berlin. From there we had to get to
the Lehrter Station. Without local knowledge
ourselves, we had gathered an idea of how to do
it. Kent was to be guide and acting manager,
but he kept consulting me, who was well content
to follow.</p>

<p>Broadway at the most crowded hour of the
day is hardly so packed as were, that night, the
far wider streets of the German capital. It
seemed as if the whole population of Berlin were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
wandering more or less aimlessly about. Two
solid streams of people moved in opposite directions
on the pavements, and spilled over the curb
into the roadway. In a way, this was favorable
to us. Except by accident, it would have been
impossible to find us. On the other hand, it
made it difficult for a party of three to proceed
by tram or omnibus. At every stopping-place
of these public conveyances a free fight seemed
to be going on for the places inside them; not the
rush we are accustomed to complain about in
London, but a scramble in which brute force
triumphed unchecked by any trivial regard for
decent manners and the rights of others.</p>

<p>After we had alighted and threaded our way
across the Wilhelms Platz, Kent found a station
of the Underground.</p>

<p>“Take a first-class ticket for yourself. I’ll
buy two,” were his instructions, whispered in
German.</p>

<p>I bought a third-class one. I did not want to.
I was merely too funky to ask for first-class. It
meant the pronunciation of an extra word. I
could have spoken it as correctly as any German,
but suppose there was no first-class on the Underground!
They’d get suspicious! It was
very silly of me. Mistake No. 1.</p>

<p>Naturally, the third-class was crowded. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
not the custom in Germany to be polite to the
gentler sex. I knew it as well as anybody. But
when an elderly woman, looking very tired, was
clinging to a strap just in front of me, I was on
my feet before I knew what I was doing. She
declined the proffered seat in confusion. To repair
my “break,” I hastily sat down again, my
ears burning. Mistake No. 2. Kent looked
daggers at me from the opposite seat, and as
soon as he had a chance I got my wigging.</p>

<p>At the Leipziger Platz the throng was thicker,
if anything. There was not the faintest chance
of getting into a train.</p>

<p>“There are some droshkies down there,” said
Kent, pulling my arm to attract my attention.</p>

<p>“Get one!” I answered curtly.</p>

<p>The marvelous thing was that the driver accepted
us as fares. The luggage we were carrying,
and our destination, Lehrter Bahnhof, did
the trick, I believe.</p>

<p>The drive through the Sieges Allee, past the
greater atrocity of the “Iron Hindenburg,” and
farther through deserted residential streets,
was splendid. We lit cigarettes, and I regained
my coolness. I wanted it. Grimly I reflected
that two mistakes were quite enough for one
day.</p>

<p>We found the booking-hall of the Lehrter Sta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>tion
crowded at eleven o’clock. Kent and I deposited
our luggage and took our places in the
long queue in front of the booking-office.</p>

<p>“What time the eleven-forty-seven for
Hanover to-night?” I asked a porter who was
passing me.</p>

<p>“Twelve-forty-seven, but to-night only.”</p>

<p>We had almost two hours to get through,
somehow and somewhere. Not at the station,
that was certain.</p>

<p>“Follow Tynsdale and me. Keep as far in
the rear as possible, and don’t lose us,” I told
Kent.</p>

<p>The Lehrter Station is situated in the northwestern
part of Berlin. There seemed no decent
cafés near at hand in which we could spend
the time and get a drink. As we were very
thirsty, however, we found a low-class place not
very far off in which we ordered a glass of beer
each. When the waitress brought the drink she
told us ungraciously that the café was going to
be closed in a few minutes. Hastily we emptied
our glasses, glad to get out of the place with as
little delay as possible. Three German privates
were eyeing us from a table close to ours much
too attentively for our liking.</p>

<p>Outside, the previous formation was resumed.
Sauntering very slowly along, I led back past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the station again, along the river Spree, then
through the empty streets of a residential
neighborhood, and finally, by accident, into the
Friedrich Strasse with its dense throng of people.
On the way I kept up a semblance of conversation
with Tynsdale. I would not go into a
café again, so near closing time, thinking we
were safest among the crowd, which was moving
quite as leisurely as we were. Tynsdale was
content to follow me, and Kent had no chance
of pressing his objections.</p>

<p>More slowly, if possible, we sauntered back to
the station, where we arrived with fifty minutes
to spare. Having got our luggage, we spent
the time in the waiting-room and restaurant,
over beer, coffee, and lemonade. German cigarettes,
bought at the counter, enabled us to
enjoy a soothing smoke.</p>

<p>“Shall we go out on the platform now?”
asked Kent twenty minutes before train time.</p>

<p>“No; wait,” I answered. Later I explained
that, since our absence was presumably known
in camp by that time, and since there was a
chance that passports might be inspected at a
terminus, I thought it would be better if we
rushed to the platform as late-comers.</p>

<p>If I recollect rightly, Kent was to chaperon
Tynsdale as far as Hanover. At the last mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ment
I requested that he should come into my
compartment. I should have been worried
about my friends if I had traveled alone in
comparative security, and was sure of feeling
happier with Tynsdale by my side. Rightly or
wrongly, I imagined I could take care of him
just as well as Kent.</p>

<p>The train was a stopping one, and was
crowded to the last seat when we tried to board
it.</p>

<p>“Can we get into a first-class compartment?”
I asked a busy official. “There is no room in
the second.”</p>

<p>“Third and second only on this train,” he
answered, and then shoved Tynsdale and me
into an already crowded carriage, from which
he ejected a soldier who had a third-class ticket.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” I said peremptorily to Tynsdale,
who obeyed. I stood in the gangway, leaning
against the window. Kent disappeared into another
compartment.</p>

<p>Then we were off, past Ruhleben camp to
Spandau as the first stop. It appeared a foregone
conclusion that our absence was known in
camp by now. We feared that the train might
be searched in Spandau. I took some comfort
from its crowded state. When another crush of
people packed themselves into the little standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
room left, I blessed the scarcity of trains which
caused the crowding. Information has since
reached me that the camp authorities did not
discover our escape until roll-call the next morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within the next hour the compartment emptied,
until we were left alone, but for a German
N.C.O., who, fat as a pig, was breathing stertorously
in his sleep. Tynsdale was slumbering
behind his overcoat. I followed his example
for short spells, the uneasy feeling that I had
something or somebody to take care of following
me into confused dreams.</p>

<p>At the Hanover main station our luggage
went into the cloak-room and we ourselves into
the waiting-room and restaurant to have a cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>I knew Hanover fairly well, and was to conduct
my friends to the Eilenriede, a huge
public park encircling a quarter of the town.
The greater part of it is really a densely timbered
forest, where we could spend the morning,
or part of it, in safety. Tynsdale and I in
front, Kent in the rear, we wended our way
thither, as much as possible through back
streets.</p>

<p>It was a typical September morning, promis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>ing
a hot day. The life of the town was beginning
to stir: people were going to work, milkmen
were making their rounds, a belated farmer’s
cart rattled over the cobbles now and again;
from the main thoroughfares came the buzzing
of trolleys and the clanging of bells.</p>

<p>In the park Kent closed up, and we walked
abreast for a time, talking freely in German.
We felt tired, and finally sat down in a secluded
spot, surrounded by thick timber and undergrowth.
At long intervals early-morning ramblers
passed us, solitary old gentlemen, and several
couples who most decidedly felt no craving
for further company, and consequently took
more notice of us than the old gentlemen. Near
by, two women were gathering wood and loading
it into dilapidated “prams.” They were
usually out of sight, but we heard them all the
time, breaking the dry sticks into convenient
lengths.</p>

<p>Gradually the sun sucked up the mists, but the
haze of an autumn day remained. Slanting
shafts of light struck through the foliage, which
sent off scintillating reflections, where it moved
in a very slight breeze, while its shadows seemed
to dance merrily on the ground. A full chorus
of birds warbled and twittered in praise of the
warmth of the waning summer. The hum of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>sects
was in the air. A butterfly winged past
at intervals, and behind our seat a colony of ants
was busily engaged.</p>

<p>The leaves had begun to fall. They covered
the ground between the trees, but the branches
themselves only showed the dark-green foliage
of summer.</p>

<p>Our surroundings moved me intensely. I had
not seen in this way a green thing in seventeen
months of prison life. I had not been among
green trees for over three years. The seat,
hard as it was, was comfortable to our tired
bodies. We felt lazy, and when we had discussed
the night’s events, and outlined the next
move, the talk languished. We were hungry,
too. Two biscuits apiece and a rather generous
allowance of chocolate tasted good.</p>

<p>Kent told us that he had immediately found a
seat in the train, the night before. His compartment
had emptied sooner than ours, and he
had chatted through most of the journey with
his only traveling companion, a lieutenant. I
do not know how many lies he told him.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock we walked back to the town.
The heat was oppressive by now. A circuitous
route, to waste time, brought us into the main
street, the Georg Strasse. In an arcade I entered
a shop for sporting-equipment, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Tynsdale to wait outside with Kent, and obtained
two military water-bottles and an extremely
shoddy knapsack at an exorbitant price.
Kent bought cigars. A strong clasp-knife was
added to my equipment. At a tram-crossing I
inquired from a policeman about the cars to
Hainholz. I intended to repeat the trick Wallace
and I had made use of ten months before,
and avoid leaving from the main station. It
was too early to obtain a meal in a restaurant
then&mdash;about eleven o’clock&mdash;so we went into the
famous Kafé Kroepke, where we sat at different
tables in the order of our entrance.</p>

<p>On the way back from the station, carrying
our luggage and walking in the usual order, I
caught sight of a very detective-like individual
crossing the road toward us. He fell in
behind Tynsdale and me, between us and Kent.
As well as I could I watched him, but we did not
seem to interest him. While we stood waiting
for the tram, Kent closed up, and I nearly
choked with rage. I thought his instructions,
“Do as we do, but keep apart,” covered everything.
Now he was asking me questions. But,
after all, it was only leveling up the score of
the previous night against <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>At Hainholz I went to the ticket-window and
asked for two second-class tickets to Bremen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Kent had asked for one ten minutes before, and
had been told to wait.</p>

<p>“Are you two traveling together?” asked the
booking clerk.</p>

<p>“No, no. I’m traveling with my friend,”
and I waved an uncertain hand toward Tynsdale,
who looked on with an impassive face from
a seat behind us.</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to want a pass for two,
and you,” turning to Kent, who was standing
beside me, “for one?”</p>

<p>Kent signified his assent.</p>

<p>“I want two tickets to Bremen. Two!”
said I.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained the man, “I have no
tickets to Bremen in stock. I’ve got to write
out passes for you. It’ll save work, if two are
traveling together. I can make out a joint pass
for two then.” Thank heaven it was nothing
else!</p>

<p>We rushed to the platform only just in time&mdash;and
waited for half an hour for the overdue
train, another one of the parliamentary
variety.</p>

<p>Tynsdale and I got the last two seats in a
compartment occupied by a well-dressed and
well-groomed man, four flappers with school-maps,
and a very pretty woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt much relieved when the train started.
Another part of our venture had come to an
end! We had now left the direct route toward
Holland, the route by which the authorities
would expect us to travel. Cloppenburg, which
was the ultimate objective of our railway journey,
lay in a straight line not so many miles to
the west of us. Yet we were going to spend
another seven and a half hours in getting there,
and had to change the direction of our flight
twice.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with considerable composure
that I sat listening to the chatter of the
flappers and the occasional snores of the man,
and watching the landscape through the window.</p>

<p>It stretched flat to the horizon, dancing in the
heat haze. Toward four o’clock, white clouds
made their appearance in the azure sky, followed
presently by gray ones. When we drew
into Bremen Station, where we had to wait
forty minutes for another train, due to start at
half-past five, a heavy shower was drumming on
the glass roof.</p>

<p>Our traveling companions remained with us
all the way. About half an hour before we
reached our destination, the pretty lady next to
me began to make ready for her arrival. Her
hair, an abundance of it, required a lot of pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>ting
and pulling about, which did not alter its
appearance in any way to the male eye. She sat
forward in her seat, and with her back straight
and her arms raised, she assumed the captivating
pose of a woman putting the last deft
touches to her toilet. Although anxious not to
appear rude, I tried to lose none of her movements,
which were the more charming to me as
I had not seen a woman of her class close to me
for over three years. Her rounded, well-modeled
arms and shoulders showed dimly through
the thin blouse. Fortunately, she was half
turning her back toward me and my companion,
and we could gaze our fill.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she pretty!” were Tynsdale’s first
words in the station restaurant after four hours
of silence.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were having a cup of coffee, sociably sitting
together at the same table. I went out to
buy the three tickets and have a wash. To my
astonishment, there was real soap for use, not
merely to look at as a curiosity, in the station
lavatory. I made a remark about this extraordinary
fact to the attendant, who told me quite
frankly that he made it a point to have real soap,
and that it was profitable for him to buy it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
eighteen marks per pound in bulk. This implied
illicit trading, and the outspokenness of
his statement was illustrative of the general
evasion of the strict trading laws and price limits.</p>

<p>The journey to Oldenburg, our next stopping-place,
took half an hour only, but was the most
trying part of our escape. We were on the
main line to an important naval and air-ship center,
Wilhelmshaven, and although we did not
approach it within fifty miles, the fact never left
my mind. Furthermore, the compartment
Tynsdale and I were in was so crowded that we
had at first to stand. As soon as a seat became
vacant, Tynsdale slipped into it. It was next
the window on the other side of the car, happily
away from an inquisitive and extremely talkative
individual, who, having been rebuffed by
an officer and earned the hostile glare of a man
in naval uniform, lapsed for a short time only
into comparative silence. Before he opened his
sluice-gates again, I had sat down beside Tynsdale,
covertly watching the dangerous lunatic, as
I called him, and sending up heartfelt prayers
that my friend would stick to reading the book
which he held in his hand as usual. He would
not do so, however, but kept looking out of the
window, giving an opportunity every time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
felt, for our conversational friend to open fire.</p>

<p>The scheduled thirty-five minutes would not
come to an end. Even when my watch told me
that they were past, the train still kept stopping
at small stations and in the open country, and
jogging on again after a short halt. My anxiety
was great, but at last I had my reward when we
arrived at Oldenburg.</p>

<p>What is it that makes one place feel “safe”
and another menacing? In most cases it is difficult
to explain. The comfortable assurance of
security I had here, I put down to the absence
of crowds in the station, and to the fact that a
booking-office between the platforms permitted
the purchase of new tickets without the necessity
of passing through the gates with their hostile
guard of soldiers. Eighteen months earlier
the shutters in front of the windows of a similar
intermediate office at Dortmund Station,
had caused me to reflect that the authorities
wanted to force all passengers to come under
the scrutiny of the guard and the ever-present
detectives. Now the face of the clerk on the
other side of the glass appeared a good omen.
We were not in Prussia, by the way, but in the
Duchy of Oldenburg.</p>

<p>Our train was due to leave in twenty minutes
from the time of our belated arrival. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
short wait on the platform it was shunted in.
We all three bundled into the same compartment,
but took seats in different corners. We
did not carry through very carefully this show
of not belonging together, as nobody joined us.
Kent bought two small baskets of fruit from a
vendor who passed along the train, and we were
sufficiently hungry to start munching their contents
at once.</p>

<p>During the first part of this last stretch of an
hour and a half we remained alone. Dusk was
rapidly changing into total darkness. Soon it
became impossible to distinguish the names of
the feebly lighted stations. I checked them
carefully from the open time-table beside me,
lest we should alight too soon or too late.</p>

<p>At 8:30 we arrived at Cloppenburg. The first
and probably the most dangerous part of our
venture lay behind us.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">ORDER OF MARCH</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">My two companions had entrusted themselves
to my leadership for the tramp to
the frontier. My first business was to pilot
them out of town from the right side, if possible,
and, what was more difficult, by the most
favorable road. I thought it, under the circumstances,
about as hard a task as could be set me,
at the very beginning. If so slight an undertaking
as ours may be spoken of in military
terms, I should compare it to a rearguard action
and the successful withdrawal from touch with
the enemy’s advance scouts.</p>

<p>It was a very dark night. Only occasional
stars glimmered through the canopy of clouds.
I knew nothing of the town, except what little
information could be gleaned from a motor-map,
scale 1 to 300,000. The time-table had taught
us that we were to arrive at one station, and that
a train was to start from another about half an
hour later. A number of people were likely to
change from the one to the other. To follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
them, as if we were of the same mind, would give
us a start off and carry us beyond the eyes of
the railway officials. After that I should have
to do the best I could, without the help of either
a compass, which I could not consult, or the
stars, which were not in evidence.</p>

<p>As long as we were likely to meet people the
order of march was to be: I in the van, Tynsdale
and Kent in the rear, as far behind as possible
without losing touch.</p>

<p>Most of the people who had left the station
with us kept on the same road, thus proving our
calculation correct. We walked in their rear,
I carrying the portmanteau, which rapidly grew
heavy. Big trees lined the streets throughout;
their shadows made it impossible to see more
than a few steps ahead. I followed behind the
other travelers more by sound than by sight.
My companions had to keep within arm’s length
of me. There seemed to be a maze of streets,
and, trusting to luck, I turned into one of them.
We found ourselves alone. At another corner,
instinct bade me take a sharp turn to the right.
Then the streets lost their character as such.
Houses seemed to be irregularly dotted about on
bare ground underneath towering trees. Again
they drew together into a street, or a semblance
of one. Here my friends closed up, and I gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the leaden-weighted portmanteau to Kent. A
furtive peep at the compass heartened me a little.
It seemed as if open country appeared in
front, but it was difficult to tell. Near a lamp,
three girls passed us, arm in arm. Inquisitively
they turned their heads.</p>

<p>The road ascended and curved, fields were on
each side, the silhouette of a house in front; to
the left, perhaps fifty yards away, the ragged
outlines of a wood.</p>

<p>“We’re in the open,” I announced, “and on a
favorable road, I think. Let’s go into that
wood and pack our knapsacks. What time is
it?”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes past nine,” answered Kent,
who carried the luminous wrist-watch.</p>

<p>It was only a thin belt of trees in whose shelter
we arranged our loads, and discarded the
white collars and shirts we were wearing.
From the southward came the barking of a dog
and the noise of railway traffic. The dog was
not far away. Whether it was because of his
bark, or because of a light we saw, we sensed a
house in the same direction, near enough to call
for careful handling of our electric torches. It
was not necessary to warn my friends. They
were squatting cautiously close to the ground,
never rising above a sitting posture, and screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>ing
the light with their bodies. It was I who received
a mild rebuke from the very cautious
Kent. I do not think my action deserved it, but
I was so elated that its chastening effect was,
perhaps, good. Not forgetting the fact that we
had yet to pass two strongly guarded lines&mdash;the
river Ems and the Dutch frontier&mdash;I felt, nevertheless,
that our task was more than half accomplished.</p>

<p>When we had finished, I bade my friends lie
down, one on each side of me, so that I might use
the flashlight for a thorough scrutiny of the
map. I recognized the road on our right without
difficulty. It was a second-class one, and divided
the angle between the two highroads. As
to direction it was entirely favorable; as to
safety it was preferable to a first-class highway.
A brook was marked on the map as flowing
across it not very far away, and this was of almost
greater importance than anything else, for
we had not been able to fill our water-bottles.
We were thirsty, but not uncomfortably so as
yet. My experiences had taught me the paramount
necessity of always having sufficient
water. How to get it began to occupy a great
part of my thoughts from now on.</p>

<p>“It’s quite obvious,” I remarked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> “We’ll
follow this road through Vahren village. We’ll
find water at about twelve o’clock. At about
one-thirty we’ll turn at right angles into this
road, which will lead us to water again, and then
into the northern high-road.” I went in detail
over the prospective night’s march. “And
now,” I finished, putting map and torch into my
pocket and getting up, “good luck to us! Come
on. I’ll be in front till further orders.”</p>

<p>Once on the road, starting at a good pace, we
turned our faces toward the west, toward Holland,
and toward freedom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I recall the events of my first two escapes,
I am astonished at the clearness with
which every minute’s happenings are imprinted
on my mind. I need only close my eyes to
see the sights, hear the sounds, and, in a measure,
be under the influence of the same emotions
which I then experienced.</p>

<p>It is somewhat different with my recollections
of this last escape. For the greater part they
are as bright as they can be. But there are
blurred patches in the pictures of my memory.
A number of them seem wholly obliterated.</p>

<p>Soon after everything was over we wrote
down the course of events. These notes and
our maps are helping me now in my efforts to
recall the next five days. But even at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
of fixing our recollections with pencil and paper,
while they were not yet a week old, our joint
efforts proved inadequate in filling a blank of
about six hours in the second night of our walk.</p>

<p>It was a glorious sensation to feel a road
under our feet, and to have the open country
about us. It was about the time of the new
moon. The rain had ceased hours before, but
the clouds were still obscuring the stars, and the
night was exceedingly dark.</p>

<p>In due course the first village was indicated by
a few scattered houses&mdash;the outposts, as it were.
We slowed up.</p>

<p>A dense mass of black shadow lay in front of
us. Not a light was to be seen anywhere.
Slowly we advanced, until the faint outlines of a
roof here and a gable there detached themselves
from the overshadowing groups of enormous
trees, which embowered the village completely
in dimly seen masses of foliage. With stealthy
steps, almost groping, we entered the blackness,
which seemed to close behind us. Nothing
broke the silence except the rattle of a chain
once or twice, and the muffled lowing of a
cow. By contrast it seemed light when we
emerged into the open again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>“We ought to get to water in half an hour
now. Look out for it. It’ll be a small stream.
We might miss it,” I counseled. Kent was
close behind me with Tynsdale.</p>

<p>Half an hour&mdash;three-quarters of an hour&mdash;but
no water. Instead we entered another
village, not marked on the map. Among the
houses a road branched off to the north. I was
awfully thirsty. My tongue lay heavy in my
mouth.</p>

<p>“Let’s try to cut off that corner,” said I.
“The other branch of the brook may exist in
reality. I think this road will curve round to
the northwest or west, and get us there quicker.
It’s not marked on the map.”</p>

<p>My friends were always willing to follow my
suggestion, and we tried it.</p>

<p>The road curved west, then west-by-south.</p>

<p>“Stop a moment! We had better go back to
the old route. I don’t like this very much now.”</p>

<p>Again Tynsdale and Kent followed obediently.</p>

<p>This was the first instance of many in which I
did not allow myself to be guided by my instinct,
as I should have done if I had been alone. I felt
so strongly my responsibility toward my friends
that I disliked taking any move I could not fully
explain by cold reasoning. Instinct is generally
unreasonable. Besides, it does sometimes lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
one astray. In our case it might compel us
to walk across-country, and the cross-country
stretches in this part of Germany looked forbidding
on the map, being mostly marked as
heather, moors, and swamps.</p>

<p>Having regained the former road, I discovered
after a while that it was turning too much
to the south. I was still musing about this when
we entered a smooth, broad, first-class highway.</p>

<p>“Let’s rest for a spell,” I suggested.</p>

<p>We sat down, with our feet in the ditch, close
to the trunk of one of the enormous trees lining
the roadside.</p>

<p>“Do you know where we are?” asked Kent,
after I had consulted the map and sat blinking
again to accustom my eyes to the night.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” I snorted irritably.
“We’re on that beastly southern highway I
wanted to avoid. I wish I hadn’t been such a
fool as to abandon the other road. I don’t
know how we got here. The map shows no
connecting road down to here at all. The only
damage done, as far as I can see, is that we have
increased our distance from water. We can hit
the by-road leading north, if we follow the
<em>chaussée</em>. Oh, I’m thirsty! I’ll try a cigarette.”
We all lit up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Three abreast we started again.</p>

<p>“There’s a sign-post,” said Kent, whose eyes
were exceptionally good.</p>

<p>“To Molbergen,” it read, pointing along a
straight by-road at right angles to our direction.</p>

<p>“This is the one we are looking for,” I announced.
“How do you feel, Tynsdale?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly keep my eyes open,” he made
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon get water,” I said, to console
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk ahead as a pace-maker,” suggested
Kent.</p>

<p>“Good!” It appeared a splendid idea.
“I’ll take the rear. Tynsdale had better follow
you close, to get the benefit of your pace-making.”</p>

<p>Kent led with a swinging pace along the
sandy, rutted road for an hour and a half. The
country stretched flat on each hand, often
broken by patches of forest. A telephone line
on our left irritated me with the monotony of
its ever-recurring, never-ending succession of
poles. I had the old sensation of walking up-hill.
We found no water. Then we came to
the northern highway, into which we swung by
a turn to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time my tongue was sticky. I had
the feeling of a crust having formed at the corners
of my mouth. Neither Tynsdale nor Kent
felt thirst so acutely. A little way down the
<em>chaussée</em> I stopped.</p>

<p>“There is a house over there. I’ll see
whether or not there’s a well. They must have
a water-supply,” I remarked.</p>

<p>Tynsdale and Kent waited in the road at
first, but soon followed me. The solitary building
stood about fifty paces from it, and a well
with windlass and protecting roof faced its
western side. No pail was attached to the wire
rope, but an old cast-iron pot lay on the ground
beside the stone coping. This we tied to the
end of the rope with pieces of string, and, turning
the handle of the windlass cautiously, let it
down. When it came up, filled with very cold,
wonderful water, was there ever anything so delicious?
We drank in turns, not once, but many
times; then filled our water-bottles, and drank
most of the remaining liquid.</p>

<p>We passed through another village in the
course of the remaining hours. Behind it we
came to a large brook, not marked on the map,
which rushed gurgling underneath the stone
bridge. I insisted upon another drink and a replenishment
of our water-bottles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t keep awake any longer,” complained
Tynsdale a little later.</p>

<p>“I suppose we had better take a rest, then.
Don’t you think so, Kent? We’ll just turn off
the road and lie down underneath that hedge
there. Only for half an hour, mind. We must
find decent cover before dawn.” This was at
half-past three.</p>

<p>We spread the oilskins as a ground-cloth and
rolled ourselves into our overcoats. I wanted to
keep awake, but fell asleep as promptly as the
other two, not to awaken until an hour afterward.</p>

<p>“Get up, quick! No time to lose. Get up!”
I aroused my friends. Not more than about
half an hour was left us in which to find good
cover. Already the air struck my cheek with
the damp chill of dawn. It “smelled” morning.</p>

<p>We packed in haste, and hurried along the
road. Once, and again, we turned into a by-road,
which seemed to be leading toward a wood.
But scattered trees near the horizon produce
in the dark the impression of a forest, since only
their outlines can be seen against the sky. We
found each time that we had been lured into a
fruitless quest.</p>

<p>The eastern horizon was graying when we
came to a small spinney at a cross-roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>“This will have to do,” I said, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>Pressing toward the heart of the thicket, and
using my torch to avoid stabbing branches, I
discovered a noose in a bush for trapping birds.
I showed it to my friends. “This doesn’t look
like security, does it?”</p>

<p>In the densest part of the spinney we halted.</p>

<p>“Wait a few minutes, will you? I’ll see
whether or not I can find something better near
at hand.” With that I left them. I explored
our immediate surroundings without success, located
a house in the vicinity, and finally had
some difficulty in finding my companions.
When I thought I was near them I whistled
softly, to be answered by Kent, not three feet
away. My friends had prepared a camp, and I
lay down by them on the oilskins. The two
overcoats we spread over us, and the oilsilks
on top. The knapsacks served as pillows, and
almost in a moment we were asleep.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ROAD THROUGH THE NIGHT</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">We woke up in full daylight, which revealed
the scantiness of our cover. By
merely raising our heads we could see people
and vehicles pass along the roads, and the
sound of voices and the creaking of wheels were
at intervals very distinct all day. That it is
very much more difficult to see into a thicket
than from it, was a consolation with which we
reassured ourselves repeatedly. I do not think
the others felt any more nervous than did I,
who thought we were safe as long as we kept
our recumbent position. We hardly moved during
the sixteen hours, I believe.</p>

<p>We ate our rations in two instalments and
with interruptions slept a good deal. We never
got as much sleep again in one day while in
Germany. I doubt that we got as much until
all was over.</p>

<p>Occasional gleams of sunshine during the
morning became ever rarer as the afternoon
wore on. Gray clouds threatened rain more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
determinedly as the day grew old, but a strong
wind which was soughing in the branches overhead
kept it off until evening, when it started
with a small preparatory shower or two.</p>

<p>When the light began to fail, we packed up
and sat about in our raincoats, talking in undertones
and listening to the pat-pat-pat of occasional
drops among the leaves. The roads had
become deserted as darkness fell.</p>

<p>At 9:30 we started our second night’s
progress.</p>

<p>Two considerations had determined my theoretical
choice of route for the night. One was
the desirability of keeping well to the north of
an artillery practice ground on the hither side
of the river Ems, the other the question of
water.</p>

<p>In order to carry my intentions into effect, we
intended to leave the first-class highway for a
communication road which was to branch off in
a village about an hour’s walk ahead. It was to
lead in a tolerably straight line across a desolate
stretch of country of no small dimensions.</p>

<p>Soon after our start, the drizzle of rain turned
into a regular downpour which drummed noisily
on oilskins and hats. A sign-post with the
distance from Cloppenburg gave us our exact
position, and enabled us to calculate the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
of ground covered on the previous night. We
made it 28 kilometers (17½ miles).</p>

<p>Again we looked in vain for the brook which
we had expected to find during the first hour.
The water we carried was getting low, and I was
anxious to have the bottles full again, and to get
a good drink. In the first village we came to,
the gurgling of a rain-spout was too tempting,
and in spite of the protests of my friends I
drank copiously and filled my bottle, whereupon
they followed my example. It was just as well
that they did so, for more than twenty-four
hours were to elapse before we had another, and
less enjoyable, opportunity of slaking our thirst
with more than a mouthful at a time from our
bottles, which was all we permitted ourselves between
sources.</p>

<p>To our very circumscribed vision, the village,
and all those we had passed through so far, and
would have to traverse yet, were of the same
type. At night their streets, ill defined among
the loosely scattered farm buildings, were
wrapped in impenetrable blackness, and both
safe and difficult for men in our position to follow.
Two steps to one side, and one’s companions
were lost to sight. To distinguish between
the road and a by-lane leading nowhere was frequently
impossible, without the help of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
swiftly stabbing, instantly extinguished cone of
light from our torches.</p>

<p>In this and the next village we came to I would
not risk taking any of the likely-looking by-roads,
without some extra assurance, such as a
sign-post would have given me, of finding the
right turning. Sign-posts were conspicuous by
their absence. During the whole night we found
only two, neither of them any good for the purpose
in hand, and they were the last we saw for
the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>Consequently we continued on the first-class
highway, which was easy to follow, until it
joined the southern road again in the village of
Werfte. This was about half-past one in the
morning.</p>

<p>The high-road from now on continued due
west through flat, monotonous, and swampy
country. As fast as we could we pushed along,
Kent making pace with his usual swinging gait,
hour after hour. For our objective we had two
small lakes, shown on the map as touching the
road on its northern side. They were to supply
us with water before we went into hiding.
Close behind them, a single third-class road, impossible
to mistake, was to start us north on the
third evening on our quest for our proper latitude,
and in avoidance of the northern end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the artillery ground, by this time not more than
eight or nine miles in front of us.</p>

<p>The second sign-post we saw that night not
long before dawn enabled us to fix our position
with accuracy, but a little later we came to the
conclusion that our maps had played us false
again. The lakes were nowhere in sight, though
we ought to have passed or reached them.
Since we had left Werfte the track of the steam-tram
had accompanied the road on our right,
and a screen of bushes and woods had interfered
with our view to the north. Now we burst
through them, bent on finding a hiding-place
away from the road.</p>

<p>“There’s the lake!” shouted Kent, pointing
over the black expanse to where, like a shield of
dull silver, the surface of the water glimmered
three quarters of a mile to the north-northeast.
It was too late to approach it then. To the
north of us, a small thicket, looking as usual
many times its actual size, invited us to rest.
We advanced toward it over springy, heather-covered
ground and across several wire fences.</p>

<p>On the banks of a deep ditch, scantily sheltered
by bushes, young trees, some furze and
heather, we made camp. It was a fairly safe
place, for the reason that, as we saw later, there
was no house within a third of a mile&mdash;at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
moment we thought there was no dwelling within
several miles&mdash;nor any tilled land.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our resting-place on the bank of the ditch had
been selected from the standpoint of concealment
only. It was most uncomfortable to lie on.
Before the sun had cleared the horizon, we were
awake again.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased after midnight, and now a
boisterous wind was dispersing the last clouds
which hurried across the sky from the northeast,
tinted rosily on their under side. The air was
extraordinarily clear. Its refreshing coolness
quickly drove the last cloying remnants of sleep
from our brains. The sun rose. Far away, to
the east, the church spire of Werfte stood
sharply defined above the smudge of green
which indicated the village.</p>

<p>I crept away from my friends during the
morning to glean some information, if possible,
by a look from the other side of the thicket, toward
the west. The pale blue of the sky above,
speckled by hurrying clouds, the flat rim of the
sky-line, broken by two distant villages, the line
of the road by which we had come, continuing
toward the large village of Soegel, and a solitary
farm, seven hundred yards away, made up
the landscape. While I lay watching behind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
furze bush a country cart crept across my circle
of vision. Between me and the invisible road a
number of cattle sounded unmelodius bells with
every hasty movement of their heads.</p>

<p>“We needn’t look for the road to-night.
It’s there, to the west,” I announced, rejoining
my friends. “We can break camp early and get
water as soon as dusk is setting in. After that
we’ll go northwesterly across country, turn
north on the road,” etc. I outlined the next
night’s march. Our plans were very elaborate,
but came to naught.</p>

<p>“All right,” my companions nodded assent.
“Now have something to eat.” They were
munching away at their rations. For a time
we chatted in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>“There is a much better place to lie in just
behind us. It looks safe enough,” suggested
Tynsdale, worming his way back to us through
the bushes after a short absence.</p>

<p>“Yes; let’s shift! I saw it, too,” seconded
Kent.</p>

<p>So we shifted, and soon lay comfortably ensconced
in the lee of some bushes. Here we
were bothered by mosquitoes, for the air was
still, but we felt warm, and managed to snatch
some sleep during the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>At 8:30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> we were plodding through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
heather toward the lake, which glimmered at
the bottom of a shallow depression. We were
licking our lips in anticipation of the drink we
were going to have. Two hundred yards from
the shore the ground became marshy, then a
quagmire. We strung out in line abreast in
order to find a firm path to the water’s edge, but
had to desist in the face of impossibilities.</p>

<p>Rain had been threatening for the last four
hours, but was still holding off, when we got on
to the road, and proceeded north. We had
walked steadily for an hour or so. The night
was pitch-dark. Black and flat swamp-land extended
all round to the indistinct horizon. Here
and there the lighter streaks of ditches, full of
foul, stagnant water, were ruled across the black
expanse. The wires of a telephone line on our
right hummed in the wind.</p>

<p>We were walking as best we could&mdash;I a little
in front on the right, Tynsdale on the other side
of the road, Kent almost treading on my heels.
The ribbon of turf underneath my feet seemed
fairly broad.</p>

<p>A sudden splash behind me caused me to stop
and whirl round. A white face at my feet
heaved itself, as it seemed, out of the ground,
and Kent scrambled back on to the road, squirting
water from every seam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did <em>you</em> know you were walking within half
an inch of a ditch? How is it <em>you</em> didn’t fall
in?” he demanded savagely of me.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” I counter-questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit! The water was just deep enough
to cover me entirely, except my knapsack. That
seems dry,” he answered, feeling himself all
over. “I’ve lost my hat, though.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. Never mind the old
hat. I hardly ever wear it.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then! Keep moving, or you’ll
catch a chill.”</p>

<p>After about one hour and a half, during which
a number of paths had demonstrated the unreliability
of our maps in this locality, none of
them being marked, a cart road on our left
proved too much of a temptation for me.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows game,” I asked, “to follow
me over uncharted ground? I feel certain I can
do better by compass alone, and probably save
us several miles.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make speeches, old man; get along.
We’ll follow.”</p>

<p>I was fortunate in being able to justify this
move. Three quarters of an hour afterward
we struck a highway a mile in front of the vil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>lage
of Spahn, our nearest objective. Pleased
with myself, I announced a clear gain of about
three miles. Here we took it easy for about
twenty minutes, sitting in the road, with our
feet in the ditch. Kent and Tynsdale had a
draft from the brandy flask, and we all had
something to eat.</p>

<p>“This is the fifth shrine we’ve seen since
Monday night. I always thought northern Germany
was entirely Protestant,” Kent remarked
when our scouting for water at the entrance
of a settlement had led us around the structure.</p>

<p>“We’d much prefer a well, anyway,” was
our unanimous opinion.</p>

<p>We simply had to have water. After searching
among the houses we finally found a rain-tub
half full of it. It contained a fair number
of insect larvæ, to judge from the tiny, soft
bodies passing over our tongues while we drank,
but we continued our march with heavy water-bottles.</p>

<p>The name of the village, in black letters on a
white board, dispelled any possible doubt as to
our position. A white post close to this sign
elicited my angry comment:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’d like to know how many of these beastly
poles with the direction boards missing we’ve
seen so far! Do the Boches think they can make
it more difficult for an invading army or something,
by knocking their sign-posts to pieces?”</p>

<p>For the next hour and a half our way lay
through dense forest. The straight, very wide
clearing which served as a road was ankle-deep
in sand. As it yielded and gave way under the
backward pressure of our hurrying feet, it produced
the nightmarish sensation of striving
hopelessly in a breathless flight against a retarding
force. Thousands of fireflies dotted
the roadside with points of greenish light, or
drew curves of phosphorescence in the air. A
heavy shower urged us to assume the sweltering
protection of our raincoats. Several times I
checked the direction of the road at its beginning,
and even borrowed Tynsdale’s compass
for the purpose, as the needle of mine seemed to
move sluggishly, but I noticed nothing wrong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next village, which we entered soon after
midnight, looked quite different from what we
had expected. It was of considerable size.
The streets were in darkness, although electric
street lamps were installed. But the yellow
squares of numerous lighted windows told of
many inhabitants not yet in bed. Near the
church we turned into a road on our right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Among the last houses I checked the road’s direction.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the road we want,” was my conclusion.
“Leading too directly north. We’d
better go back and look for the right one.
What d’you think?”</p>

<p>“D’you think it safe?”</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t much time to spare. But
the streets are dark enough. We might risk
it.”</p>

<p>Again we passed in front of the church. In
what looked like the vicarage at one side, three
large windows lit the road in front. A shadow
passed over the blinds. A door banged. Hurriedly
we dived into the shadow farther on.
The footfalls of a single man sounded behind us,
ominously determined it seemed. It was too
dark to see more than three or four yards, but
we were sincerely glad when the sound was
gradually left behind and we found ourselves
in the open country on a sort of cart track.</p>

<p>“This isn’t the road, either. Too far west
this time,” was my conclusion. “The former
road is the better of the two. We’ll strike back
to it across-country.”</p>

<p>We did so in twenty minutes’ work over
fields. It soon began to tally better with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
direction on the map. Two hours through firefly
infested forest saw us enter another village,
as dark and as safe as any we had yet passed
through. At its farther end we stopped.</p>

<p>“We’ve simply got to see whether we can’t
get more water,” I said. “I don’t really know
where we are. I expect it will be all right, but
I do not know how long it will take us to find a
brook. These farms must have a water-supply
somewhere. Just wait at the corner here. I’ll
go scouting. If anything happens to me, I’ll
make enough noise to let you know of it. Then
you can scoot out of the village and wait for me
a reasonable time somewhere along the road.”
And I left them protesting mildly.</p>

<p>Across a manure-littered farmyard I splashed
stealthily into a sort of kitchen-garden, as it
turned out. Standing there I used my flashlight
once for a look round. From behind me,
right over my head and in easy reach, stretched
the large branch of a tree, bending under a
heavy load of apples. The first I touched remained
in my hand at once, which showed them
to be ripe. I crammed my pockets and filled my
hat. I got almost thirty. Then I joined my
companions, who were getting impatient and
anxious. It never occurred to me to send Tynsdale
and Kent to get their quota, nor did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
think of suggesting it. I am still regretting the
omission. We divided the spoils, and sank our
teeth into the hard, juicy, sweet flesh of the
fruit which had tempted the Mother of us all.</p>

<p>At the end of the village a broken sign-board
lay in the ditch: “Village of Wahn, Borough of
&mdash;&mdash;, District of &mdash;&mdash;,” etc. With a sinking
heart I fumbled for my map.</p>

<p>“Form round and let’s have a look,” I said.
“Here we are! I’m beastly sorry; I’ve been
a fool! We took the wrong road at Spahn.
That big village was Soegel, not Werpeloh, as I
thought. No wonder we were puzzled. No
wonder I almost got us into a hopeless mess.
Fortunately we are clear now, and, but for water,
better off, if anything, than on our proper
route. Let’s be traveling now, and see whether
we can make Kluse. It’s a little over six
miles.”</p>

<p>The mistake was a very bitter pill for me to
swallow. The fact that no harm had come of it
was little consolation. One simply must not
make mistakes on an escape.</p>

<p>Forest and swamp-land, telegraph-poles and
fireflies, and drumming showers of rain, and we
were, oh, so tired!</p>

<p>At 3:45 a very large, solitary building on our
right lured me toward it in search of the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>cious
liquid. It was an enormous sheep stable,
the packed occupants of which set up a terrified
bleating when the ray of my torch struck accidentally
through a hole in the wall. A motion
to get into the loft for a good day’s sleep was
negatived on Kent’s determined opposition, as
too dangerous.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we dragged ourselves into
a thick pine copse, pitched camp in impenetrable
darkness, moistened our lips with some vapid
rain-water, and fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">CROSSING THE EMS</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">It was still dark when I opened my eyes. A
steady sound was all around me, and close at
hand a more definite one: Tap-tap-tap-tap.
I was only half awake.</p>

<p>I stretched out my hand and put it into a pool
of water which had formed on the oilsilk covering
us. It was raining heaven’s hardest.</p>

<p>Half an hour of disjointed thinking brought
me to the conclusion that we had better do something.
As yet the overcoats underneath the oilsilks
were hardly wet. The first gray light of
dawn was beginning to filter through the close-standing
trees.</p>

<p>“Wake up! Wake up! It’s raining,” I
called. “We’ll get soaked, and we don’t want
to carry an extra thirty pounds of water on our
backs.”</p>

<p>I got on my feet. With the heavy clasp-knife
bought in Hanover I lopped off the branches
just over our heads and stretched an awning of
oilsilks three feet above the ground, attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
ineffectually to make them shed the water over
the edge of the shelter, instead of letting it accumulate
on us. For a time it was all right;
then the rain ceased.</p>

<p>By now the light showed that we had camped
far too near the road for proper concealment.
But the awning had found approval in the eyes
of my friends, and I felt such pride in the contrivance
that I hesitated to advise moving camp
farther into the thicket. Instead, I set to work
to camouflage it with a screen of branches and
young trees, which I cut off and stuck in the
ground. I got myself much wetter by doing all
this than if I had taken things quietly. So did
Tynsdale, who was infected by my passion for
work.</p>

<p>When a cart creaked along the road, its wheels
plainly visible from our hiding-place, we resolved
to move. In the heart of the thicket the
trees were much smaller&mdash;only a little taller
than ourselves&mdash;and more widely spaced. This
and the open sky above us gave us a sensation
of freedom and fresh air. I constructed another
shelter. Occasional showers during the
morning filled the sagging places of the awning
with water, and this we drank in spite of the
bitter taste imparted to it by the oiled fabric.</p>

<p>Sleep, even in the intervals between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
showers, was almost out of the question. With
the day, thousands of mosquitoes had come to
life among the grasses covering the ground.
They rose in clouds wherever we went, and attacked
the rash beings who unexpectedly had
penetrated into their fastness. Soon our
hands and faces were red and swollen with their
bites.</p>

<p>About noon the last clouds disappeared. The
sun began to pour down from a deep blue sky,
its rays falling hot and scorching into the windless
space between the trees. We divested ourselves
of our wet upper garments, and spread
them on the firs around us to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>The only sounds that came to us were the occasional
tooting of a tug on the river Ems, now
not more than three miles to the west. The
rarer and nearer shriek of a railway engine on
a line parallel to its bank interrupted every now
and again the zzzz-ping, zzzz-ping, of the hovering
mosquitoes. A dog barked near by. A
slow cart rolled and creaked past the copse.</p>

<p>The road in front of the thicket was converging
toward the railway, which it met three to
four miles to the north of us at the village and
station of Kluse, a little more than two miles to
the east of Steinbild and the river Ems. Two
and a half miles to the north of this last village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
a wood was indicated on the map. This was our
next objective.</p>

<p>From information received, we supposed the
Ems to be strongly guarded by sentries and patrols.
The five-mile-wide ribbon of country between
its western bank and the Dutch frontier
was <em>Sperrgebiet</em> (closed territory). Nobody
was allowed to enter it except by special military
permit. A day’s observation from the
shelter of the forest was to show us how best to
cross the river&mdash;whether we could swim it, with
or without luggage, and if necessary, to permit
the construction of a small raft to ferry the
latter across. Perhaps we could steal a boat!</p>

<p>Near the station of Kluse we intended to
cross the railway line, sneak through the village,
and then walk across-country to the river and
the forest.</p>

<p>Dusk found us behind some bushes by the
deserted roadside, awaiting the night.</p>

<p>We started early, walking slowly at first, to
squander time. As darkness thickened, we increased
our pace. But it is difficult to speed up
when one has started slowly. Perhaps the village
and station were farther away than we
thought. Anyhow, it seemed an age before we
caught sight of the first signal-lights on the rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>way.
As during the previous night, the road
lay through perfectly flat, desolate swamp land,
crossed by ditches of stagnant water. A wood
accompanied us on our right for some time.
The stars were occasionally obscured by drifting
clouds.</p>

<p>Suddenly we saw a cluster of red signal-lights
over the dim shape of a signal bridge, the
lighted station building a hundred yards beyond,
and a level crossing turning out of our
road at right angles. “This is it,” I said.</p>

<p>We stepped across the metals. Just beyond
them, a small building on our left, its windows
lighted, cast a glimmer over the road. Apprehensively
glancing round I passed into the deep
shadow of the avenue beyond it.</p>

<p>A little later we were standing on a bridge in
the small village. A considerable brook rushed
gurgling underneath.</p>

<p>“When we passed that house,” Tynsdale said
casually, “a large dog of the police type came
after me. I was walking last, you know. The
brute pushed his nose into the back of my knee
and turned away without a sound!”</p>

<p>We had a good drink at the brook, then proceeded
along the cut-up road, tree-lined and
dark. In a likely spot, perhaps five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
yards behind the village, I stopped. “Here’s
where our cross-country work starts; keep close
behind.”</p>

<p>As nearly as possible we proceeded in a northwesterly
direction. The going was bad. The
country was divided by wire fences, deep ditches
and hedges, into small fields, most of them
swampy meadows. Half the time we waded
through water over the tops of our shoes. This
continued for an indefinite period, and terminated
when we reached a road where it
curved from a northerly direction toward the
southwest. Here I had what proved to be an
inspiration.</p>

<p>I had seen the beginning of the road marked
on the map farther north. On paper it terminated
nowhere. Actually it was here, in a spot
where it ought not to be. Its deeply rutted surface
showed that it was frequently used. The
village of Steinbild, to the south of us now, was
obviously its destination.</p>

<p>I explained to my companions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> “I’m as
certain as I can be that this road enters Steinbild
close to the water’s edge and avoids the
main street. The curve seems to show that.
I’d like to follow it. To lie in the woods, away
from anywhere, and watch the river, may not
gain us anything. In the village we may find
a boat. We’ve any amount of time, anyway,
and can always come back. It’ll not be so very
dangerous, with due caution, if the place is as
dark as the villages we have seen so far. Will
you chance it and follow me?”</p>

<p>“We’ll follow wherever you lead,” said Kent
heartily. Tynsdale’s nod I took for granted; I
couldn’t see it.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour we were among scattered
houses. Again, five minutes later, we
stood in the shadow of tremendous trees, in such
darkness that we were aware of one another’s
presence only from the sound of breathing and
small movements.</p>

<p>In front of us the mirage of a few stars danced
uncertainly on the smooth surface of a fairly
wide river. A fish splashed noisily while we
stood listening for suspicious sounds.</p>

<p>We moved carefully along the river path,
upstream, to the south. The trees continued in
unbroken, stately procession. A barge of the
large German steel type lay half-way toward
midstream. A boat was tied to its stern.
Something, I forget now what it was, made us go
on&mdash;I have a dim recollection of a light in its
cabin. Another barge, with a boat by her side,
loomed up, riding high on the water and without
cargo, opposite a tiny pier of earth, which ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
perhaps twenty yards from the boat. In a
house, some distance farther up, one lighted
window winked in the night.</p>

<p>We were standing on the pier.</p>

<p>“Who’s to get that boat?” asked Tynsdale.</p>

<p>“Draw lots for it,” I suggested. The shortest
piece of match remained in my hand. Off
came my knapsack.</p>

<p>“Going in all standing?” inquired Kent.</p>

<p>“No fear; nothing like doing things comfortably.
Get out that towel, will you, and be
ready.”</p>

<p>My clothes were off. Cautiously I slipped
into the water. I remember distinctly, even at
this moment, that my toes gripped the sticks
forming the foundation of the pier. The bank
fell vertically beyond my depth. Bracing myself
against the cold shock, I pushed off, to be
taken into a delicious tepid embrace by the
kindly river. Two long strokes. I paused to
feel the current. There was none. Three
more. The boat loomed above me. Shooting
up, I caught the gunwale at the stern
with the tip of my fingers. “Bump, bump,
bump,” went the bows against the lighter’s side
in feeble movement. “Bump, bump, bump.”
I had drawn myself up, and clambered in.
“Bump.” I stood in the bows, fumbling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the painter, which was big enough to serve
a young White Star liner for a hawser.
“Bump.” The gap between lighter and boat
widened as I shoved off carefully.</p>

<p>I grabbed at a pole lying in the bottom of the
boat. The water proved too deep for punting,
so I used it as a paddle, standing on a forward
thwart.</p>

<p>The boat was an enormously clumsy affair.
Tynsdale snatched at the painter when the bows
touched the pier. “Get into your things, we’ll
do the rest.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the brandy.” Kent solicitously
handed me the flask. I didn’t need it, but
thought I deserved a pull.</p>

<p>When I was dressed, I joined my friends, and
we put our things into the boat. Tynsdale, who
had grown up among shipping, had swung her
round, so that her nose pointed downstream.
We clambered in.</p>

<p>Kent and I were sitting in the bow when he
pushed off, and started to propel us across the
river in proper waterman’s style with an oar
he had found in the bottom of the boat. Silently
working it over the stern, he guided her
round the counter of the barge, underneath the
wire cable which connected the latter with the
one lower down, and out into the placid stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a word was spoken after we got clear.
The large bulk of the empty barge dwindled
as the strip of water widened between us. The
trees on the bank we had left grew smaller, a
trembling line of light glimmered on the surface
of the river from the winking window of the
cottage. Then the other bank grew distinct and
high. The boat’s nose swung upstream and
touched. I am not quite sure who was ashore
first, Kent or I, but I am certain I had the
painter.</p>

<p>“Don’t let her drift,” Tynsdale whispered
from his quarter-deck, when I had scrambled
ashore. “Belay somewhere, if you can.” We
found a post with an iron ring on top, almost embedded
in the ground, and made fast. Our
knapsacks were put ashore. Tynsdale left last,
as befitted the captain.</p>

<p>“Leave her there,” he counseled. “If we let
her drift and get caught, we’ll be charged with
stealing her. They may not trouble to investigate
if they find her here.”</p>

<p>Hurriedly we retired among some bushes
which dotted the hollows along the river bank.</p>

<p>“Council of war,” I suggested in high glee.
“What’s to be done now? What time, Kent?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>
<p>“Twelve-forty-five.”</p>

<p>“What are your opinions? Are we to try
to cross the frontier to-night or not?”</p>

<p>“To-night, by all means to-night!” urged
Tynsdale. We were all very much excited, of
course.</p>

<p>“Time’s getting short! Wait until to-morrow
night!” counseled cautious Kent.</p>

<p>The decision rested with me.</p>

<p>“Time <em>is</em> getting rather short, but we might
do it. Question is, can we find cover if we
don’t? It must be good, to serve its purpose in
the Sperrgebiet. I think we ought to dump
everything we can spare, and go forward as
fast as possible. We can always alter our
minds, until after we get on to the morass.”</p>

<p>“Good!” grunted Tynsdale.</p>

<p>“As you wish,” Kent gave way gracefully.</p>

<p>“Then hurry!” I instructed.</p>

<p>Feverishly we went through our impedimenta,
thrust the remainder of our biscuits, escapers’
shortbread, chocolate, and such indispensable
things as were not already there, into our
pockets, and shoved rucksacks, overcoats, raincoats,
and everything else underneath the
bushes.</p>

<p>I knew the map too well to want to look at
it long. Had we not spent days studying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
stretch in front of us, often with the help of
magnifying glasses?</p>

<p>“What time, Kent?”</p>

<p>“One o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Give me exactly half an hour.”</p>

<p>Relieved of about thirty pounds in weight, I
set the fastest pace in my power downstream,
along the river bank. I hoped to find a path
there, which was to take us to the “jumping-off
place” to the north of us, where I intended
to get to the swamp. The path was there.
The going was easy, and comparatively safe.
Bushes dotted the banks and gave continuous
shelter.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that our procedure was
risky. We took it for granted that we should
not meet any sentries along the river, in spite
of our information to the contrary. But slow
and careful going seemed equally risky at the
time. Only speed could help us across the frontier
that night.</p>

<p>My decision in favor of trying to bring our
venture to an immediate conclusion was wrong.
I ought to have seen that it was more than
likely that we should find cover along the river.
Yet&mdash;I don’t know.</p>

<p>“The half-hour is over,” said Kent.</p>

<p>The river was flowing placidly on our right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
swirling softly. Straight across from us a
back-water lost itself between tall reeds. This
was the spot I had hoped to reach. We filled
our water-bottles and drank. Then I slid down
the bank, raised here above the surrounding
country, and started due west, followed by my
companions. Passing a few yards of scattered
bushes, with rank grass between them, I
plunged into a dense thicket of oak saplings.
Pushing and straining, I worked on, in order to
get through what I imagined to be a narrow
belt. It would not come to an end, but grew
thicker instead, finally making progress impossible.
In the light of the torch the small trees
stood impenetrably close.</p>

<p>“Here’s our cover; no time to work round
this patch, and no need to, either,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad,” commented Kent.</p>

<p>“I wish we hadn’t left our overcoats behind,”
I reflected. “Let’s see. Four hours
till daylight. We’ll be damnably cold. Let’s
go fetch ’em. Heaps of time. Nothing else to
do.”</p>

<p>Back on the river bank I tied my handkerchief
to a branch, knee-high above the ground.
After a careful look round, to impress the contours
of the landscape on my mind, we started
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>I had not the slightest misgivings about our
ability to find our knapsacks and to disappear
again into our hiding-place. The hollow where
we had left them? Gracious me! I could walk
there blindfolded. I could draw its shape now.
My cock-sureness was not at all damped by
Kent’s dismal forebodings, on which he started
as we approached the spot.</p>

<p>We found the boat, but not our luggage; we
searched for it more than half an hour, quite
recklessly at the last. There were thousands of
apparently identical hollows. They had multiplied
exceedingly during our absence. I
thought I entered them all. But our luggage
was lost, and stayed lost.</p>

<p>“No use. We’ve got to go.” I fell in with
the urging of the others at last.</p>

<p>At about 3:30 we stretched ourselves on the
dry leaves among the oak saplings and fell
asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LAST LAP</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Half an hour later we were awake again,
shivering and with chattering teeth.
The wind was rising and rustling in the canopy
of leaves over our heads. It was dark and bitterly
cold.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do something,” I announced.
“We may have rain. I’ll build a shelter.”</p>

<p>The oak saplings offered an ideal material
for an arbor, although the clasp-knife did not
bite readily through their tough fibers. Jointly
we interlaced the crowns of six or seven stout
saplings, growing in a circle, and twisted long
branches in and out of the stems. We made a
small but dense roof. The floor we covered
with small twigs and leaves to the depth of two
or three inches.</p>

<p>The exertion made the blood course through
our veins again. Before we had finished, it was
day.</p>

<p>The wind had increased to a gale, which
shrieked and roared and rustled among the fo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>liage,
sending occasional eddies even into our
hiding-place. It kept the rain off, which threatened
now and again during the forenoon.
There were no mosquitoes. I do not think there
ever are any among oaks.</p>

<p>Several excursions to the river bank, in
couples or singly, one of us always remaining
in the arbor, warmed us a little when we had
got chilled to the bone. The river path, and the
belt of scattered bushes, remained deserted all
day. But we observed a considerable amount
of river traffic. Long strings of barges, mostly
empty, were being towed upstream by powerful
tugs.</p>

<p>Tynsdale scouted toward the west, away from
the river, and reported a farm some distance
from our hiding-place in that direction, and the
existence of a pond and a belt of marsh-land behind
the thicket.</p>

<p>We slept in snatches of minutes, until the
cold awoke us again, and again sent us dancing
or scouting about. It was the most miserable
camp we had yet experienced, but the safest,
and the one where we were the least thirsty.
There was more water about us than was altogether
desirable, we thought at the time.
Twenty-four hours later, looking back, we altered
our opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from this camp to the Dutch
frontier was five miles to the west-northwest, as
the crow flies. Opposite to us the border traversed
an extensive swamp, the Bourtange Moor,
twenty-five miles in length, and between five
and seven miles in width.</p>

<p>According to our map, neither road nor path
led over it, which was one of the reasons why
we had selected it as the point to strike at.
“Information received” had encouraged our
belief that the swamps which extend along
nearly the whole of the northern frontier between
Holland and Germany can be traversed
in summer and autumn during normal years.
Other information tended to show that comparatively
they were negligently guarded. I had
never forgotten a newspaper article which I had
read in Ruhleben in the winter of 1915-1916.
A territorial had described his duties as a frontier
guard. There was one passage: “When
on duty I shared a small hut with another man.…
We had to walk two hours to the nearest
post.” Two men to guard a two-hours’ stretch!
Ridiculous! Camouflage! but still&mdash;</p>

<p>Our route would be across the northern half
of the moor. I had talked it over with my companions
many a time.</p>

<p>“There is this large forest at the north end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of the swamp. If the recent rains have made
the swamp impassable, we’ll have to make for
it and try to cross the frontier where it runs
through the wood. I should hate to have to do
that. A hundred to one, sentries there will be
as thick as flies in summer. But we may have
no alternative. For that eventuality, we will
take the most favorable course across the
swamp, walking west by north. Since we must
continually go round bad places, we will make
all corrections northerly, and thus edge off toward
the wood, and lessen the distance in that
way.</p>

<p>“These two roads, parallel to the river, which
we shall have to cross before getting on to the
swamp proper, will be dangerous. I shouldn’t
wonder if sentries and patrols were to be found
on them. But I cannot imagine how they can
easily relieve a man on a trackless morass; can
you?”</p>

<p>At 5:30 we ate our last meal. A very slender
one it was. We reserved only some chocolate
and the tin of Horlick’s malted milk tablets,
which we always had looked upon as our emergency
ration. These we divided into equal
shares.</p>

<p>At 5:45 I advised the cutting of long, stout
staves. They would be useful, I thought, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the work ahead of us. I had no idea that they
would make all the difference between failure
and success.</p>

<p>At 6 o’clock we could not stick it any longer
inside the thicket. We made our way out, and
walked up and down behind the bushes, waiting
for darkness.</p>

<p>Of course we were on edge. I do not think
we had had in all eighteen hours’ sleep since
Saturday. It was now Friday. And we were
merely waiting, waiting for the time when we
could act, when the game was to be decided. We
were not very nervous, but we were subdued.
I think we all believed we should succeed, although
I tried to look on the black side of things.
It seemed so impossible that three years&mdash;three
years!&mdash;of captivity should come to an end.
Did we look far ahead? I remember that my
mind went no farther than to visualize a river, a
mile or so across the border, which was to tell
us that we were free!</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared, the wind lulled into
silence. The sky, brushed free of clouds,
spanned pale blue from sky-line to sky-line. A
crescent moon had peeped her last over the
western rim of the world, and followed the sun.
The shadows were growing dense underneath
bush and canopied foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>The river murmured sleepily as we went to
drink. Tynsdale crouched against the steep
bank and handed up the full bottles, one by one.
We took up our staves and very slowly walked
down the river, before it was quite dark, looking
for open country on the left.</p>

<p>The stars had come out, one after another.
Quickly their numbers increased, until myriads
of them twinkled and glittered. It was an absolutely
ideal night for our purpose.</p>

<p>The oaks on our left came to an end. A shallow
depression, with the glint of water here and
there, intervened between us and the rising
ground some distance away.</p>

<p>“Here we start,” said I, “on our last lap!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Eight-thirty,” said Kent.</p>

<p>“Come on!” I answered.</p>

<p>Descending from the river bank, we found the
ground most difficult. Two or three wide drainage
ditches were crossed with the help of their
sluice-gates, smaller ones we jumped with our
staves. Then came marshy meadows and open
patches of water. For about an hour we were
almost always in over our ankles, frequently
much deeper, wandering through the shallowest
places.</p>

<p>In a sort of dell, on rising ground now, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
small copses to right, left, and in front, we
halted, removed our boots and emptied them of
water, and wrung out our socks and trousers.
This was quite necessary. The squirting noise
of our steps advertised our presence a long way
in the still night.</p>

<p>Here, if I mistake not&mdash;it may have been a
little later&mdash;we arranged the order of our
march. I took the van. My task was to pick
the way to keep the direction. Kent, next, was
to pay particular attention to our nearer surroundings,
try to spot danger&mdash;sentries and patrols,
etc.&mdash;and keep count of the time. Every
four or five hundred yards he was to signal
“down,” when we were to “flop.” By this
manœuver we would contract the horizon and,
perhaps, spot sentries against the sky-line.
Tynsdale, in the rear, was to check the direction,
and speak, if he saw me apparently make a
wrong move. All of us were to keep our eyes
wide open and all senses on the alert.</p>

<p>When we topped the rise we sank down silently.
There was the first road, across our
course, hardly discernible on the black, flat expanse.
Nothing moved; no sound, except that
of our own breathing, disturbed the stillness.
Obliquely across some fields we came to the second
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>Again we crouched. “All’s well. Go on.”</p>

<p>After that, a smooth, very springy surface
made agreeable walking for a short time.</p>

<p>“Hou&mdash;” I started.</p>

<p>“Houses to left and right in front!” whispered
Kent. Again we looked and listened.</p>

<p>They were two small single structures, standing
perhaps three hundred yards apart, as if
dropped from a giant child’s play-box. When
I had led through the space between, a path was
found to run past them.</p>

<p>Now began the swamp proper, as flat and as
black, at first, as a congealed lake of asphalt,
covered with the same exceedingly short growth
we had already encountered, like very tiny
heather plants, or their densely intertwined
roots, and very springy with the concealed bog
underneath.</p>

<p>With the greatest care I kept the north star
just a little in front of my right shoulder. We
were advancing rapidly. There seemed no possibility
of sentries standing on a trackless waste.</p>

<p>I felt very sure of myself, very much exhilarated,
very happy. We had time to notice our
surroundings. They were eerie in the extreme.
We were in the center of a perfect circle, black
as pitch, except for some whitish patches ahead.</p>

<p>Those whitish patches came nearer. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
we approached I tested with my staff. Firm
sand! They increased in number, flowed together
here and there. Only narrow black
strips now, connected with larger black areas beyond.
Suddenly, one of the white spaces, not a
whit different to look at from those we had already
crossed, was water. Correction north.
They were all water! We were being pushed to
the north at a great rate. So I corrected southerly
once or twice, at first, then alternately with
a northerly deviation.</p>

<p>It was nerve-racking business to pick the way.
Our deliberate halts and surveys had grown
more infrequent as the involuntary ones increased
in number. Occasionally we had seen
and crossed a track.</p>

<p>I think Kent had just announced “Twelve
o’clock,” when&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pfattt!” said a rifle, far to the north. We
stared intently in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>“Pfattt!” it repeated spitefully; “pfattt!”</p>

<p>We could not see the spit of flame. It must
have been in the wood. Later, when we met
the men whom the bullets had been meant for,
this proved to be correct.</p>

<p>Without a word to the others I turned due
west. The swamps are kindlier than German
riflemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>We left off making any remarks. We were
too strung up for talk.</p>

<p>“This is a patch of a different kind,” I
thought. Like dull silver it gleamed under the
stars, not half as bright as the others. The
ground was very unstable all about us. I could
feel slow waves rolling sluggishly under my feet,
caused by my own and my companions’ footsteps
on the thin carpet of vegetable matter covering
the morass. When I tested the patch I
found it to be slime. Correction southerly, all
southerly now, to edge away from the wood.
The areas of slime increased in number, multiplied,
flowed together. The third I came to
seemed to offer some resistance to the probing
staff at first, then the pole went in as into water.
I lost my balance. My left foot swung forward,
to find another hold. Instantly it was under the
surface. Just as quick Kent’s arms were about
me. Violently he jerked me back, I clinging to
my staff.</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>The ground got worse and worse. Some of
the slimy places which appeared firmer than
the rest we crossed. Flat-footedly we slithered
over them one after the other, our staves held
horizontally.</p>

<p>Abruptly we were in the peat cuttings&mdash;great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
yawning holes and ditches, running mainly from
north to south, black, with sometimes a star or
two, mirrored in the foul water a foot or so below
the edge. The passage had to be made
across bridges of standing peat, hardly ever
more than two feet wide, which swayed as we
shuffled over them. I held grimly to the western
course, as well as I could. Going south
seemed easier, but that direction meant no progress
toward the frontier, rather the reverse.
And north? No, thank you! Not after those
shots.</p>

<p>I was standing precariously balanced on a
peat bridge, the pole thrown far forward as a
third leg&mdash;oh, those precious poles!&mdash;when a
splash sounded behind, and a gurgling noise.
Kent had gone in.</p>

<p>“What’s happened? Can’t you help him?
I can’t!” I called to Tynsdale.</p>

<p>We were under far too great a stress to feel
any particular emotion. At any rate, I was.
And as to helping, I couldn’t even turn my head
without losing my balance.</p>

<p>Before Tynsdale could reply, I heard a slight
scramble, the swishing of water, and then Kent’s
subdued voice expressing his entirely unsubdued
opinion about peat cuttings. Part of his
particular bridge had crumbled under his foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
He had fallen into a hole. The stout oak sapling,
carried firmly in both hands, one end of it
rammed into the ground for a hold, had fallen
across the opening, its other end descending
on firm ground. It had kept Kent suspended.
Only his legs had gone into the water.</p>

<p>The incident decided me. “South,” I called
over my shoulder.</p>

<p>A short time later, the peat holes grew
scarcer.</p>

<p>“West!”</p>

<p>There were the slimy patches again! We
went around a few. Most of them we crossed
in a bee-line. They seemed firmer here. A few
much smaller sheets of water! Then again a
flat, unbroken, springy surface.</p>

<p>We were all going strong, out to make westing
as fast as we could put our feet to the
ground; no thought, now, of crouching.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A barbed wire, behind it a deep, wide ditch,
beyond that a plowed field, were in front of us.</p>

<p>The human mind is a queer contrivance. We
had just negotiated some rather ugly ground.
We had not bothered about, hardly become
aware of, the risks we had taken. Now we were
hesitating for a few moments in front of a ditch
with firm sides which, at the worst, we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
easily have waded. At last we jumped, landing
in the water half-way up to our knees. I lost my
precious aluminium water-bottle there. Then
across the field, across another ditch, and so
four times.</p>

<p>On the way I asked Tynsdale: “Nothing to
remark about our course?”</p>

<p>“I thought you altered it, and swung due
west at one point.”</p>

<p>“Yes, after the shots.”</p>

<p>“Intentional?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Thought so.”</p>

<p>A canal, seemingly in course of construction,
was crossed on a large tree-trunk, which bridged
it. Kent and I did it astride. Tynsdale
walked. Two hundred yards farther we stood
on the banks of another full-grown canal.</p>

<p>“We must be in Holland,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to say so,” replied Kent.
“You know there’s a canal parallel and close
to the frontier on the German side, forty or
fifty miles farther south.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s marked on our map, and this
isn’t.”</p>

<p>“A river, not a canal, was to show us we were
in Holland!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<p>“True, but they may have turned the river
into a canal. Man, the frontier runs across the
swamp. We’re off the swamp. We’re in Holland,
I bet you what you like.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to be so cock-sure.”</p>

<p>“But I am. Here, do you want to swim
across?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“All right! We’ll turn south along its
banks!”</p>

<p>Soon we came abreast of a house which lay a
hundred yards or so to the east, toward Germany.</p>

<p>“Let’s go have a look,” I suggested. We
did so.</p>

<p>The whole character of the cottage, for such
it was, struck me as un-German. I pulled out
my torch: “This isn’t German. Look at that
front door. Decorated with painted flowers!”</p>

<p>Kent arrived breathlessly from somewhere:
“This can’t be Germany! There is a big dish,
full of potatoes, on the table in the front room!”</p>

<p>“Let’s knock!”</p>

<p>We knocked. We had no time to ask questions,
for, before the last rap had sounded,
“Holland! Holland!” called a male voice from
within.</p>

<p>Holland! We stood and looked at one another
silently, then retreated a few steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheers, boys,” I said. “Hip, hip, hip&mdash;”</p>

<p>Three feeble cheers seemed to be immediately
swallowed up in the darkness. How thin, weak,
and far away our voices sounded!</p>

<p>Then we turned, to make our way to the nearest
village.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smaller">FREE AT LAST</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">We had only gone a few steps when a man
came running after us. His Dutch and
our German made conversation possible. Kent
was rather good at understanding and imparting
his meaning.</p>

<p>“Orlog gefangenen?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Yah, yah!”</p>

<p>“Roosland?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay; Engelsch!”</p>

<p>“Engelsch?” He gripped our hands and
shook them warmly. Then we had to accompany
him back to his cottage. He ushered us
into the room where Kent had seen the “big
dish, full of potatoes.” His wife, in picturesque
undress, fired a volley of questions at her
husband, clasped her hands, shook ours, and began
lighting the kitchener. Two daughters&mdash;or
were there three?&mdash;emerged from cavernous
cabin beds, let into the wall. Shyly they dressed
in front of us.</p>

<p>Then the table was loaded with things to eat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
We had fried veal, bread, butter, and plenty of
milk and hot coffee. All this was offered us
spontaneously in a farm laborer’s cottage at
2:30 in the morning. Enviously I watched my
companions enjoying their meal. I was too
done up to make more than a show of it.</p>

<p>A little later the man accompanied us to the
nearest village, Sellingen. He walked in front
with Kent, Tynsdale and I followed in the rear.
The walk was a nightmare to me. Our guide
carried a lantern. I could not keep my eyes off
its reflex on the ground. The direct rays
stabbed intolerably into my eyes. It seemed to
hang in a Gothic archway, which always kept
receding in front of me. I was almost convinced
of the reality of the archway.</p>

<p>“Can’t we get through that gate?” I asked
Tynsdale.</p>

<p>“What gate? Here, where are you going?”
and he pulled my arm and saved me from walking
slap into the canal. After that I pulled myself
together and felt better. Both my friends
were much fresher than I.</p>

<p>We arrived at the village at last, and were
given a delicious bed on plenty of straw, with
plenty of blankets.</p>

<p>Kent was up early next morning. He accepted
I do not know how many successive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>vitations
to breakfast, while Tynsdale and I
slept until half-past seven. In the course of the
morning we were taken to a military station at
Ter Apel by the village policeman, who appeared
in his best uniform, with two huge silver
tassels at his chest.</p>

<p>The very atmosphere was different. A sergeant
in whose special charge we were placed
regretted that he could not put proper rooms at
our disposal. “But since the gentlemen will
have to be quarantined first, they will perhaps
understand if we keep them away from upholstered
furniture.”</p>

<p>We had a wash, and an excellent meal, with
a bottle of port.</p>

<p>“Did you meet any sentries?” we were asked.</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“Where did you cross over?”</p>

<p>“North of Sellingen.”</p>

<p>“You came over the swamp, then?” with elevated
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Yes, right across.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<p>“You were lucky. Up to a fortnight ago,
sentries stood along the frontier at one hundred-meter
intervals. Then they were withdrawn,
because the swamp became impassable. You
were fortunate, too, in getting across the Ems.
A great many fugitives get drowned in it.”</p>

<p>“Once, during my first attempt, I got caught
on Dutch soil by the Germans,” I remarked in
the course of the conversation.</p>

<p>“What? On Dutch territory? Where was
that?” The sergeant was very much interested.</p>

<p>“I can show it to you on a map. It was northwest
of Bocholt.”</p>

<p>He disappeared and returned with maps and
telegraph forms. I told him my story, and he
made notes and wrote two telegrams.</p>

<p>“What you say is possible,” he said at last.
“Our men stand three hundred meters behind
the actual frontier.”</p>

<p>The next two nights we spent in a hutment
in Coevorden. We met a number of Russian
privates and N.C.O.’s there, who had made
good their escape and were, like us, waiting to
be sent to a quarantine camp. Among them
were three who had crossed the same night as
we, but through the woods at the northern end
of the swamp. We were indebted to them and
their dead comrade on German soil for the
warning shots at midnight.</p>

<p>There followed a fortnight in quarantine camp
in Enschede. Under the Dutch regulations, any
person “crossing the frontier in an irregular
manner,” without a passport, viséd by a Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
consul, is subjected to this quarantine. We
tried to shorten our stay there, pleading that
we came from a healthy camp. We were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>We did not like Enschede camp. The food
was insufficient for us, who could not live almost
exclusively on potatoes. We found it
strange that we should not be allowed to supplement
our rations by purchasing extra food.
The only things we could buy, at first, were apples
and chocolate, and only a limited amount
of either. Our deep gratitude is due, however,
to Mr. Tattersall of Enschede, who indefatigably
looked after us and the other Englishmen
in Enschede camp, much to the disadvantage of
his pocket.</p>

<p>After we had received a clean bill of health,
being civilians, we were allowed to proceed to
Rotterdam without a guard. We arrived there
at ten o’clock one night, and I was promptly arrested,
being mistaken for an embezzler who had
decamped the same day from somewhere, taking
fifteen thousand florins of another man’s
money with him. My health passport saved
the situation.</p>

<p>The next morning we were at the British
consulate. The rest of the day we careered
through the town in a motor-car&mdash;from the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>sulate
to the shipping-office, from the shipping-office
to somewhere else, from there to the consulate’s
doctor, back to the shipping-office and
the photographer, and again to the consulate.
That night we were on board at Hook of Holland.</p>

<p>Two days afterward&mdash;!</p>

<p>In the gray dawn of an autumn morning our
small ship heaved to the incoming swell as she
steamed out to take up her station in the convoy.
Soon she was dancing joyously to the
shrilling of the wind and the sizzling swish of
the seas. Two long, low gray shapes accompanied
us on each quarter. Hardly discernible
at first, they grew more distinct with the
light. There were more of them, but invisible,
guarding the long line of ships. Occasionally
other shapes appeared on the horizon, very faint
in their war-paint.</p>

<p>Toward evening I saw again the well-remembered
piles of a British landing-stage. How
often had I pictured them during three long
years! It was always there that I had imagined
my home-coming. It had become reality.</p>

<p>Six weeks later: Time: 10 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> Enter servant.</p>

<p>“You’re wanted on the ’phone, sir.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t want to give a name, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.&mdash;Hullo! Hullo!”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Keith?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Who’s speaking?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize my voice, Eric?”</p>

<p>“No, can’t say I do.”</p>

<p>“It’s Wace!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Me&mdash;Wallace, Wallace!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!”</p>

<p>“Yes; arrived last night! Speaking from
Hackney. <em>You</em> know!”</p>

<p>So Wallace had won through too, though
playing a lone game!</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
